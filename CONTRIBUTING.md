# Contributor License Agreement

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There is just one thing you need to do first...

Contributions to Google projects, even unofficial ones like this, must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement. 
This is not a copyright assignment, it simply gives Google permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project.

https://cla.developers.google.com

You generally only need to submit the Google CLA once, so if you've already submitted one for a different project, you probably don't need to do it again.

After your contribution is included, you will be listed in [CONTRIBUTORS](CONTRIBUTORS) and/or [AUTHORS](AUTHORS) files; 
CONTRIBUTORS is the official list of people who can contribute (and typically have contributed) code to this repository, while the AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders.

# Font Requirements

If you would like to include a font family in the Google Fonts collection we'll be very happy to include it, if it meets the following criteria:

* The typeface design is original, or a legitimate revival of a design in the public domain, and of good quality. You can get the quality reviewed by posting review requests in the [googlefonts-discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/googlefonts-discuss) group, and the [typedrawers](http://typedrawers.com/categories/critiques%E2%80%94type-design) review forum.
* The project is licensed under the [SIL Open Font License v1.1](scripts.sil.org/OFL), with no Reserved Font Name
* The project is developed on Github or similar, with complete corresponding sources, [open](http://producingoss.com) to public participation, and actively maintained. Sources mean the fonts are available in the preferred form of modification, plus reproducible build instructions or scripts
* All font files are available in TTF format, with hinting (such as with [ttfautohint](http://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/))
* All font files have at a minimum the 215 glyphs listed in our [latin_unique-glyphs.nam](https://github.com/google/fonts/blob/master/tools/encodings/latin_unique-glyphs.nam)
* All font files within the family have the same Unicode character set (unencoded glyphs can differ)
* A `README.md` file is included in the root of the source repository with [FONTLOG](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ofl-faq_web#43cecb44) information, and your name and Google+ profile link, so that we can prepare a description ([example](https://github.com/google/fonts/blob/master/ofl/poppins/DESCRIPTION.en_us.html)) and link your name to your profile ([list](https://github.com/google/fonts/blob/master/designers/profiles.csv))

When your project meets these criteria, please [file an issue](https://github.com/google/fonts/issues) with a link to the source repository.
(In the future we hope to provide guidance on making pull requests directly, but since we carefully check the technical aspects of the fonts, its better to work with us on your upstream project.)
