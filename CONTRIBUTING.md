# Contribute to Google Fonts

In June 2022, we introduced new detailed documentation to help people contribute to Google Fonts, the [Google Fonts Guide](https://googlefonts.github.io/gf-guide/).

## Feedback

If you have any feedback on Google Fonts API, catalog website, or the fonts themselves, please create an issue at [github.com/google/fonts/issues](http://github.com/google/fonts/issues).
Don't forget to search in the issue tracker (using keywords) to check if your topic has already been raised, before opening a new one.

We have some issue templates for common topics:

- [Submit an OFL Font](https://github.com/google/fonts/issues/new?assignees=&labels=II+New+Font%2C+>+Submission&template=1_add-font.md&title=Add+%5BFont+Name%5D)
- [Submit a font upgrade](https://github.com/google/fonts/issues/new?assignees=&labels=II+Font+Upgrade&template=2_update-font.md&title=Update+%5BFont+Name%5D)
- [Report a problem with a font](https://github.com/google/fonts/issues/new?assignees=&labels=II+Font+Bug&template=3_font-bug.md&title=)
- [Anything else](https://github.com/google/fonts/issues/new?assignees=&labels=II+API+%2F+Website+%2F+Platform%2C+II+Tools+%2F+workflow+%2F+repo&template=4_anything-else.md&title=)

## Adding and Upgrading families

The Google Fonts Guide has a chapter dedicated to the [requirements for font submissions and upgrade suggestions](https://googlefonts.github.io/gf-guide/onboarding.html).
Please read it carefully.

If you are able to meet these requirements yourself, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/google/fonts/issues) with a link to the project's source repository.
In special circumstances, you can request an exception to these requirements on your issue.

If you are a non-technical person who has developed a high quality typeface in a GUI application and are happy to meet all these requirements in spirit but need someone else to take care of all the technical stuff, Google Fonts also accepts submissions via email.
Send an email to <fonts@google.com> with an attachment that includes complete source files, along with a clear statement you are the sole original author and are licensing the source files under OFL, with a request that we take care of everything else. 

From time to time, Google Fonts provides financial and design assistance for projects. 
If you would like to discuss this, please mention that you would like someone to contact you privately when filing an issue (and have contact details on your Github profile page.)

## Contributor License Agreement

We love to accept all good patches and contributions to this project. 
There is just one thing contributors need to do first...

Contributions to Google projects must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement. 
This is not a copyright assignment, it simply gives Google permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project.

<https://cla.developers.google.com>

You generally only need to submit the Google CLA once, so if you've already submitted one for a different project, you probably don't need to do it again.

After your contribution is included, you can be listed in [CONTRIBUTORS](CONTRIBUTORS.txt) and/or [AUTHORS](AUTHORS.txt) files; 
`CONTRIBUTORS.txt` is the official list of people who can contribute (and typically have contributed) code to this repository, while the `AUTHORS.txt` file lists the copyright holders.
