# Web Font Recomendations

Try to avoid strokes that go left of the origin (0 on the X axis) since they may be 'clipped' in some web pages - especially in Swash Cap fonts.  Since Caps are often used either at the start of a word or all together, if you space your caps normally and then shift them and their right side bearing ALL to the right by the SAME amount, you will find that they clip less when starting a line, but look okay when used to Start Words inside sentences (the preceding word space will be a little wider than usual and this is often imperceptible), and they will also work as normal in all caps settings because they are all shifted by the same amount. 
*Thanks to Victor Gaultney for suggesting this technique.*

Counters and apertures should not be too small, very fine details should not be too fine, because they will not appears on low resolution screens.

Thin strokes should not be as thin as their print fonts equivalents. 
[Pinyon Script](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pinyon+Script) is a good example of how a high contrast font can be developed specifically for the web, with thins that are not too thin.
