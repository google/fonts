# Investigation Report: Aclonica

## Summary

Aclonica is a sans-serif display typeface designed by Brian J. Bonislawsky (Astigmatic). It was added to Google Fonts on 2011-04-27. The METADATA.pb has no source block. The only known upstream repository is `librefonts/aclonica`, which contains TTX-decomposed font data and a `.vfb` (FontLab binary) source file. There are no gftools-builder compatible sources (.glyphs, .ufo, .designspace) in the repository. A config.yaml cannot be created because the sources are in a proprietary binary format (VFB).

## Investigation Details

### METADATA.pb Current State

The current METADATA.pb has no `source { }` block at all:

```
name: "Aclonica"
designer: "Astigmatic"
license: "APACHE2"
category: "SANS_SERIF"
date_added: "2011-04-27"
```

### Binary File History in google/fonts

The font binary has been modified exactly twice:

1. **Initial commit** (`90abd17b4`, 2015-03-07): Added `Aclonica.ttf` (68,784 bytes)
2. **Hotfix PR #742** (`25a9400f0`, 2017-05-01): Renamed to `Aclonica-Regular.ttf` (68,732 bytes), updated METADATA.pb fields. Authored by Marc Foley.

PR #742 was a hotfix that renamed the file, updated the full_name and copyright fields, and slightly modified the binary (52 bytes smaller). The PR body was empty, providing no information about where the binary was sourced.

### Upstream Repository: librefonts/aclonica

- **URL**: https://github.com/librefonts/aclonica
- **Cached at**: upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/librefonts/aclonica
- **Status**: Active (not archived)
- **Commits**: Single commit (`2746e45`, 2014-11-03) - "update .travis.yml"

The repository contains:
- TTX-decomposed font tables (`.ttx` files) for Aclonica.ttf
- `src/Aclonica.vfb` - FontLab binary source file
- `LICENSE.txt`, `COPYRIGHT.txt`, `DESCRIPTION.en_us.html`
- `METADATA.json` (legacy format)
- `src/VERSIONS.txt` reports "Aclonica.ttf: Version 1.000"

The `librefonts` organization was used for automated TTX decomposition of early Google Fonts families. These repos served as archival/CI mirrors rather than true upstream development repositories. The original designer (Astigmatic / Brian Bonislawsky) does not appear to have a GitHub repository with the original sources.

### Source File Analysis

The only source file is `src/Aclonica.vfb`, which is a FontLab Studio binary format. This is **not compatible with gftools-builder**. There are no `.glyphs`, `.ufo`, or `.designspace` files in the repository. A config.yaml cannot be meaningfully created.

### Commit Hash Determination

The repo has only one commit (`2746e45`). This commit does not correspond to any specific onboarding action in google/fonts. The librefonts repo was created in 2014, while the font was onboarded in 2011, and the last binary update was in 2017 (PR #742). The hotfix binary was likely generated by Marc Foley using ttfautohint or similar tooling, not built from this repo.

## Conclusion

### Recommended METADATA.pb Source Block

```
source {
  repository_url: "https://github.com/librefonts/aclonica"
}
```

### Notes

- Status: **no_config_possible** - The only source file is `Aclonica.vfb` (FontLab binary), which is not compatible with gftools-builder.
- The `librefonts/aclonica` repo is not a true development upstream -- it is an archival TTX decomposition. The original VFB source from Astigmatic is included but cannot be used by modern build tooling.
- No commit hash is included in the source block because the repo's single commit does not correspond to any specific build or onboarding event in google/fonts.
- The font binary in google/fonts was last updated in PR #742 (May 2017) as a hotfix by Marc Foley. The exact source for that binary is unknown.
- Confidence is MEDIUM because while the repo URL is correct (it is the only known repository), it does not contain buildable sources and the relationship between the repo and the google/fonts binary is indirect.
