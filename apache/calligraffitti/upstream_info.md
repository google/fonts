# Investigation Report: Calligraffitti

## Summary

Calligraffitti is a handwriting typeface designed by Open Window (Dathan Boardman). It was added to Google Fonts on 2011-01-06. The METADATA.pb has no source block. The only known upstream repository is `librefonts/calligraffitti`, which contains TTX-decomposed font data but no actual source files (no .vfb, .sfd, .glyphs, .ufo, or .designspace). The `src/` directory only contains metadata text files. There are no buildable sources anywhere in the repository. A config.yaml cannot be created.

## Investigation Details

### METADATA.pb Current State

The current METADATA.pb has no `source { }` block:

```
name: "Calligraffitti"
designer: "Open Window"
license: "APACHE2"
category: "HANDWRITING"
date_added: "2011-01-06"
```

### Binary File History in google/fonts

The font binary has been modified exactly twice:

1. **Initial commit** (`90abd17b4`, 2015-03-07): Added `Calligraffitti-Regular.ttf`
2. **Hotfix PR #765** (`5ca10f1e0`, 2017-08-07): Updated `Calligraffitti-Regular.ttf`, updated METADATA.pb fields (full_name, copyright, subsets). Authored by Marc Foley. PR body was empty.

The hotfix renamed `full_name` from "Calligraffitti" to "Calligraffitti Regular", cleaned up the copyright string (removed email address), and dropped the `latin-ext` subset.

### Upstream Repository: librefonts/calligraffitti

- **URL**: https://github.com/librefonts/calligraffitti
- **Cached at**: upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/librefonts/calligraffitti
- **Status**: Active (not archived)
- **Commits**: Single commit (`983f7f3`, 2014-10-17) - "update .travis.yml"

The repository contains:
- TTX-decomposed font tables (`.ttx` files) for Calligraffitti-Regular.ttf
- `LICENSE.txt`, `COPYRIGHT.txt`, `DESCRIPTION.en_us.html`
- `METADATA.json` (legacy format)
- `src/METADATA_comments.txt` - subsetting commands for the font
- `src/VERSIONS.txt` reports "Calligraffitti-Regular.ttf: Version 1.001"

### Source File Analysis

The `src/` directory contains only:
- `METADATA_comments.txt` - Shell commands for font subsetting
- `VERSIONS.txt` - Version string

There are **no source files** of any kind in this repository:
- No `.vfb` (FontLab binary)
- No `.sfd` (FontForge)
- No `.glyphs` or `.glyphx` (Glyphs)
- No `.ufo` (Unified Font Object)
- No `.designspace`

The `librefonts` organization repos were automated TTX decompositions of early Google Fonts families, not development repositories. For Calligraffitti, the original source files were never included. The designer (Dathan Boardman / Open Window) does not appear to have a public GitHub repository with the original sources.

### Commit Hash Determination

The repo has only one commit (`983f7f3`). This commit does not correspond to any specific onboarding action in google/fonts. The librefonts repo was created in 2014, while the font was onboarded in 2011, and the last binary update was in 2017 (PR #765). The hotfix binary was likely generated by Marc Foley using ttfautohint or similar post-processing, not built from this repo.

## Conclusion

### Recommended METADATA.pb Source Block

```
source {
  repository_url: "https://github.com/librefonts/calligraffitti"
}
```

### Notes

- Status: **no_config_possible** - There are no source files of any kind in the repository. The repo only contains TTX decompositions and metadata files.
- The `librefonts/calligraffitti` repo is not a true development upstream -- it is an archival TTX decomposition created by the librefonts project. The original source files from Open Window / Dathan Boardman were never included.
- No commit hash is included in the source block because the repo's single commit does not correspond to any specific build or onboarding event in google/fonts.
- The font binary in google/fonts was last updated in PR #765 (August 2017) as a hotfix by Marc Foley. The exact source for that binary is unknown.
- Confidence is MEDIUM because while the repo URL is the only known repository for this family, it contains no buildable sources and the relationship to the google/fonts binary is indirect (TTX decomposition of the binary, not the other way around).
