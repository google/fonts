Crafty Girls is inspired by crochet hooks, yarn, button boxes, thread, and glitter. 
This delightfully playful casual handwriting script font was hand drawn by Crystal Kluge and makes the perfect compliment to all your projects.
Use it in your very best creative projects, then blog about them in the same font!
