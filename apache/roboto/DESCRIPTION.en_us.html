Roboto sans serif has an impeccable uniformity with a good dose of easiness. 
It’s a dual-natured type of the sans serif family that is mechanical, and at the same time features friendly and open curves.   
The font doesn’t distort its form to force a rigid rhythm, instead the letters settle into their natural width. 
This aids in legibility and gives it a harmonious rhythm that works well for both text and headlines

<b>Updated July 2020:</b> Upgraded to a variable font with Weight and Width axes, that closely match the previous static fonts released as two families, this one and a sibling Roboto Condensed family.
