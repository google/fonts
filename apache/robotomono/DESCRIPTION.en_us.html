<p>
Roboto Mono is a monospaced addition to the <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto">Roboto</a> type family. 
Like the other members of the Roboto family, the fonts are optimized for readability on screens across a wide variety of devices and reading environments. 
While the monospaced version is related to its variable width cousin, it doesn&#8217;t hesitate to change forms to better fit the constraints of a monospaced environment. 
For example, narrow glyphs like &#8216;I&#8217;, &#8216;l&#8217; and &#8216;i&#8217; have added serifs for more even texture while wider glyphs are adjusted for weight. 
Curved caps like &#8216;C&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217; take on the straighter sides from Roboto Condensed.
