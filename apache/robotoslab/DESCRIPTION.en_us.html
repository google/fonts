<p>Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are
largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open
curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm,
Roboto doesnâ€™t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural
width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in
humanist and serif types.</p>

<p>This is the Roboto Slab family, which can be used alongside the normal 
<a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto">Roboto</a> family and the 
<a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Condensed">Roboto Condensed</a> family.</p>

<p>In November 2019, the family was updated with a variable font "Weight" axis.</p>
