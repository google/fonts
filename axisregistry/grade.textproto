  "Finesse the style from lighter to bolder in typographic color, by varying"
  " stroke thicknesses or other forms, without any changes overall width,"
  " inter-letter spacing, or kerning, so there are no changes to line breaks"
  " or page layout. Negative grade makes the style lighter, while positive"
  " grade makes it bolder. The units are the same as in the Weight axis."
