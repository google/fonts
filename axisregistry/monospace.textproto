description:
  "Adjust the style from proportional (natural widths, default) to"
  " monospace (fixed width). Monospace is when all glyphs have the same"
  " total character width, and more wide or narrow letter proportions to fill"
  " the space such as a narrower 'w' or wider 'r.' Proportionally spaced"
  "fonts have letters drawn with more typical proportions, and each glyph"
  "takes up a unique amount of space on a line."
