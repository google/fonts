  "Adapt the style to specific text sizes, specified in Points. At smaller"
  " sizes, letters typically become optimized for more legibility, with loose"
  " spacing/kerning and thicker strokes with less detail. At larger sizes,"
  " letters are typically optimized for headlines with thinner strokes and"
  " more detailed forms, and more extreme weights and widths. When used in"
  " CSS, this axis is activated by default, but not all products/platforms"
  " use it automatically."
