  "Adjust the style from narrower to wider, by varying the proportions of"
  " counters, stems, and other forms including overall spacing and kerning."
  " This typically changes the apparent weight (what typographers call"
  " 'typographic color') in a subtle way, and so may be used in conjunction"
  " with axes for Width and Grade (if present)."
