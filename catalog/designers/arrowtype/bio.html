<p>Arrow Type is the type design & development studio of Stephen Nixon. It is named for symbols ( ← ↑ → ↓ ) that
    are highly useful and present all around us – from public wayfinding to digital user interfaces – yet missing from
    the character sets of many traditional fonts. Arrow Type seeks to uncover and explore other such underserved facets 
    of design & technology, from the aesthetic to the cultural.
