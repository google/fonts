Arthur Reinders Folmer attended the Royal Academy of Art, the Hague, and afterwards started his own design studio in Haarlem, the Netherlands, where he specialises on combining typography and illustration. Next to his design studio, Arthur also runs his type foundry, Typearture.

Through Typearture he creates typefaces that merge concepts, culture, experiment and most importantly: a bit of humor. His designs play with concepts, conventions of written language, and embed cultural references. The Typearture fonts are a type of adventure, and they explores all the possibilities that can be contained in a font-file.
