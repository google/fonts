<p>Carolina is a designer from Buenos Aires. After 30 years of working in the industry, and part-time teaching experience in Argentina, Germany and New Zealand, took a full-time academic position at the University of Waikato.

Her education was in traditional graphic design, with a strong emphasis on typography, which became her deep interest. In 1994 she created the experimental typeface Miyuscules, one of the first Argentine digital fonts. In 1996 became a digital nomad, founded Bigital with Tomás García Ferrari, and started developing projects for clients in different countries, mainly in interactive and digital media. In 2019 she designed Mansalva, and keeps thinking about new typography projects, currently with other fonts under development.</p>
