<p>Céline Hurka is an independent type designer based in The Hague, NL. In her practice, she aims to play with, question, and break the conventions that have prevailed for the past hundreds of years. She is fascinated by how meaning is attached to form and transforms over years of usage in different contexts. Letters are cultural signifiers that add meaning to a text far beyond the words they form. Céline's typefaces are deeply personal projects and are inspired by her long-term interest in type history, technological innovation, personal stories, pop culture, nature and universal emotions.</p>
