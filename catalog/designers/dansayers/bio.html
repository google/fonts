<p>Dan Sayers is a software engineer and type designer. He studied mathematics at the University of Oxford. In 2011, he created the Averia typeface family by computationally averaging the outlines of all 725 fonts installed on his computer. The name is derived from the Spanish word "avería," meaning "breakdown," which shares an etymological root with the English word "average." Four variants are available on Google Fonts: Averia Libre, Averia Sans Libre, Averia Serif Libre, and Averia Gruesa Libre.</p>
