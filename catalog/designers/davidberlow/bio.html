David Berlow, the president of Font Bureau, is a 44-year veteran of the type industry.
Beginning his career in 1978 at Mergenthaler-Linotype, Stempel, and Haas, he moved on to one of the first digital type foundries, Bitstream, in 1982.
Berlow began consulting and sub-contracting to Apple Computer in 1989, leading development of the era-defining fonts for macOS 7 that introduced the TrueType format, and later the first variable font, Skia.
His fonts are distributed by Google, Apple, Microsoft, Adobe, Monotype, Morisawa and Type Network.
