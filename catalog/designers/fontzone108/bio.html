Font Zone 108 designs typefaces. He mainly works on Japanese fonts. Who knows, Japanese letters might not exist after 100 years. And that is why it’s meaningful to hold the beauty of it inside fonts, with the sincere wish that Japanese will remain in the future without being forgotten. That’s why his fonts are open source.
