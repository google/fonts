"Font Zone 108" is the pseudonym of a typeface designer who mainly works on Japanese fonts.
He think, who knows, Japanese letters might not exist after 100 years.
That is why he finds it so meaningful to hold the beauty of them inside fonts, with the sincere wish that Japanese will remain far into the future, without being forgotten.
Thatâ€™s why his fonts are open source.
