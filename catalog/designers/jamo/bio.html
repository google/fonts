<p>JAMO is a type design collective group based in Seoul, Korea. They provide professional education, information, and discussion to designers who are wishing to develop their own typefaces through their workshop.</p> 

<p>JAMO encourages more experimental and unconventional typeface design by getting inspirations from old types, finding an alternative usage from existing ones, and suggesting new letterforms for the future. They aim to escape from the passive practice and create more self-initiating active typefaces. JAMO offers high-quality typeface design based on the deep levels of research, planning, and study. By broadening the potential of Hangul, they propose a new type design methodology to co-live with other worldwide letters including the Latin Alphabet.</p>
