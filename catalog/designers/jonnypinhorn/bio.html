<p>After completing an MA in Type Design at the University of Reading, Jonny went on to design Karla for Google Fonts. Karla is a popular and quirky sans-serif typeface that supports both Latin and Tamil scripts. His continued fascination with India and Indian languages led him to ITF, where he worked for three years. Jonny continues to work exclusively on Indic scriptsâ€”including <a href="https://github.com/jonpinhorn/shrikhand" target="_blank">Shrikhand</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jonpinhorn/atithi" target="_blank">Atithi</a> most recently.</p>
