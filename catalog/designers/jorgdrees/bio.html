<p>Jörg Drees: A Journey from Letterpress to AI</p>

<p>Growing up in northern Germany, Jörg was surrounded by the art of letterpress typesetting, thanks to his parents' printing shop. He picked up the craft early on, and after training as a typographer, he honed his skills under Hans Rudolf Bosshard in Zurich, where he also designed his first typefaces.</p>

<p>Nowadays, he works with news publishers and explores the cutting edge of AI in layout design. Next to his professional endeavors, font design has always been a personal passion. It’s his go-to for inspiration and relaxation, and Jörg continues to create beautiful typefaces in his own time.</p>
