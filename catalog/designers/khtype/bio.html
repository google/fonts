<p>KH Type is a type foundry founded by Kurppa Hosk. We offer retail and bespoke typefaces along with other typography-related expertise, like wordmark refinements and art direction. Typography has always been intrinsically linked to the core of Kurppa Hosk’s work, and with KH Type we aim to celebrate our typographic heritage by making our independently designed typefaces available to license.</p>
