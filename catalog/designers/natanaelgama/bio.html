<p>Inspired by his early typography classes, Natanael decided to start experimenting with fonts and hasnâ€™t stopped since. He is the designer of Exo and Cinzel, two very popular web font families. In 2011 he founded NDISCOVER, a Portuguese Digital Type Foundry. Even though play has become work for Natanael, he still enjoys designing fonts.</p>
