<p>Roman Shamin is the head of design at Evil Martians and a multidisciplinary designer dividing his time between Lisbon and Istanbul.
He has developed all kind of tools: web and mobile apps, about a dozen plugins for Figma, Sketch, and Adobe apps. Including pretty raucous Size Marks for Adobe Photoshop (1.5K stars on GitHub) and Color Name for Figma (4.5K installs). Also, OKLCH Color Picker, Evil Icons (2nd Product of the Day on ProductHunt), and Recipe Scaler. 
In recent years he is running Martian Fonts, a type foundry within Evil Martians.</p>
