<p>Supernotes is the London-based company behind SN Pro, an open-source rounded humanist sans. The company focuses on building an intuitive short-form notes app, emphasizing readability, simplicity, and digital usability. In 2023, Tobias Whetton at Supernotes began developing SN Pro to address typographic challenges in Markdown-heavy environments. Drawing from Nunito, the family was reimagined with refined spacing, carefully adjusted proportions, improved ligature behavior, and expanded support for a wide range of digital contexts. SN Pro reflects Supernotes’ commitment to open-source design and practical, user-focused typography.</p>
