Vernon practiced typeface design professionally from 2007 to 2014.
A lifelong artist, during this period he eagerly explored designing type for the mobile/cloud era of computing.
His work spans all genres, from lively script faces to workhorse text families and operating system UI.
Vernon graduated with an MA in Typeface Design from the University of Reading (UK) in 2006, and passed away in California in 2014.
Almost all his typefaces live on as open source Google Fonts, and his favorite projects were Oxygen Mono, Monda, and Bowlby One.
