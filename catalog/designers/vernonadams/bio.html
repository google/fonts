<p>Vernon practiced typeface design from 2007 to 2014. A lifelong artist, during this time he eagerly explored designing
    type for the cloud-based era. His work spans all genres, from lively script faces to workhorse text families and
    operating system UI. Vernon graduated with an MA in Typeface Design from the University of Reading and lives in
    California. His designs are mostly published as open source Google Fonts and his favorite projects include Oxygen
    Mono, Monda, and Bowlby One. Follow his story at <a href="http://sansoxygen.com/"
