Color, or chromatic, fonts are fonts with two key capabilities non-color, or monochromatic, fonts don't have:

1. They can use many colors in a single glyph or character
1. The font specifies what the colors are
   * Though the user may override those colors

Contrast with a non-color, or monochromatic font which:

1. Can only draw in a single color
1. Cannot specify what the color is, only where "ink" goes
   * Some outside entity, such as CSS or a document editor sets the ink color

<figcaption>A monochromatic font can be colorized by defining the color of the ink, such as in CSS or a document editor. The font has no
input into this, it **only** defines where ink of unknown color should be placed</figcaption>
