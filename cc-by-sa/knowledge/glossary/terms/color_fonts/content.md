Color [fonts](/glossary/font) (also known as chromatic fonts) can use multiple colors in a single [glyph](/glossary/glyph), rather than a flat single color used by non-color (monochromatic) fonts. The default color values are also contained within the font file itself, although these can be overridden by the designer.

Google Fonts now supports a growing number of color fonts in its library. To narrow the library selection to color fonts, visit [fonts.google.com/?coloronly=true](https://fonts.google.com/?coloronly=true) or press the “Show only color fonts” toggle.
