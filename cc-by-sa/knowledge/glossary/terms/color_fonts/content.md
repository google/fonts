Color fonts (also known as chromatic fonts) can use multiple colors in a single glyph, rather than a flat single color used by non-color (monochromatic) fonts. The default color values are also contained within the font file itself, although these can be overridden by the designer.

Google Fonts now supports a growing number of color fonts in its library, which can be found at https://fonts.google.com/?coloronly=true
