“Extrusion Depth” (`EDPT` in CSS) is an [axis](/glossary/axis_in_variable_fonts) found in some [variable fonts](/glossary/variable_fonts) that can be used to control the depth of three-dimensional letterforms. Values are in thousandths of an [em](/glossary/em) (the current font size). For example, setting Extrusion Depth to 500 will result in a 50%-of-the-em extrusion, which would be 20 px if the font size is set to 40 px.

The [Google Fonts CSS v2 API](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/css2) defines the axis as:

| Default: | Min: | Max: | Step: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 100 | 0 | 1000 | 1 

Note that the default value is expected to differ per family, rather than be universally set for any implementation of this axis.

The axis was first used in the [Nabla font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nabla) [color font](/glossary/color_fonts), which uses isometric perspective to achieve its three-dimensional look. The extrusion depth, at its maximum setting, creates a deeper or thicker letterform. At its minimum setting, the letterform appears only two-dimensional.
