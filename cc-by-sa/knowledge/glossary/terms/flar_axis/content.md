“Flare” (`FLAR` in CSS) is an [axis](/glossary/axis_in_variable_fonts) found in some [variable fonts](/glossary/variable_fonts) that can be used to control how the strokes modulate from their upright parts to their flared extremes.

The [Google Fonts CSS v2 API](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/css2) defines the axis as:

| Default: | Min: | Max: | Step: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 100 | 1 |

Left at the minimum value, the [strokes](/glossary/stroke) are [monolinear](/glossary/monolinear); at the maximum value, more contrast is introduced to the letterforms. The effect is more noticeable in heavier font weights.
