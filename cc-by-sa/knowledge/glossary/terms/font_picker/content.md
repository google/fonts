The [font](/glossary/font) picker is the part of a user interface that specifically allows the user to choose a font. Most commonly, this incorporates a scrollable dropdown list of available fonts, often with a sub-menu or secondary dropdown for picking particular instances, such as [weights](/glossary/weight) and [styles](/glossary/style).

Depending on the software, the font picker may show the list of fonts with their names set in either the standard [typeface](/glossary/typeface) for that UI, each in their own typeface, or a combination of a regular list augmented with a preview. Some apps, such as those in Adobeâ€™s Creative Cloud and Microsoft Word, also have the ability to automatically update the selected text on the canvas, as the user scrolls through the list in the font picker.
