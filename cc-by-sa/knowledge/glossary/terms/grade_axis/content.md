“Grade” (`GRAD` in CSS) is an [axis](/glossary/axis_in_variable_fonts) found in some [variable fonts](/glossary/variable_fonts) that can be used to alter [stroke](/glossary/stroke) thicknesses (or other forms) without affecting the [type](/glossary/type)’s overall [width](/glossary/width), inter-letter spacing, or [kerning](/glossary/kerning)—unlike altering [weight](/glossary/weight). This means there are no changes to line breaks or page layout.

The [Google Fonts CSS v2 API ](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/css2) defines the axis as:

| Default: | Min: | Max: | Step: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | -1000 | 1000 | 1 |

Negative grade makes the style lighter, while positive grade makes it heavier. The units are the same as in the weight (`wght`) axis.

The first specimen, with the slider most of the way to the left to represent a negative value on the axis, shows more contrast. The second specimen, with the slider most of the way to the right to represent a positive value on the axis, shows less contrast.](images/thumbnail.svg)

In line with the current CSS spec, all custom axes should be referenced in UPPERCASE (only the OpenType registered variable axes should appear in lowercase). Also, when using the Google Fonts API, the uppercase axes have to appear first in the URL.
