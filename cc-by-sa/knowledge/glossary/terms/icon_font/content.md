An icon font is a font that exclusively contains icon glyphs rather than alphanumeric glyphs. A couple of examples are Material Icons and Material Symbols—both are icon fonts, although Material Symbols is a variable font, allowing for fine-tuning via variable axes.

Using fonts to render icons has multiple benefits:

- Being vector-based, they’re infinitely scalable, unlike rasterized images.
- Contained in one file, the file size is considerably smaller than a collection of individual images—even vector-based ones.
- When used on the web, they can be colored and positioned just using CSS, and browser support is excellent.
- When using variable icon fonts , they’re customizable in a way that allows them to be more closely matched to any accompanying type.
