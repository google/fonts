The fixed arrangement of two or more individual elements (e.g. a logomark together with a logotype) is often referred to as a lockup.

A lockup can even consist of *just* type. For instance, consider a logotype made up of two lines of text. The specific size of the type, the spacing between each line, and the overall position of the elements constitutes a lockup.
