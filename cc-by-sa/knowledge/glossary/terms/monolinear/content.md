When a [letterform](/glossary/letterform)’s [stroke](/glossary/stroke) exhibits a consistent thickness—i.e., little or no [contrast](/glossary/contrast)—the typeface is said to be “monolinear.” Typically, [sans serifs](/glossary/sans_serif) and [slab serifs](/glossary/slab_serif_egyptian_clarendon) have less contrast than [serifs](/glossary/serif).

Examples of Monolinear typefaces include [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) and [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat).
