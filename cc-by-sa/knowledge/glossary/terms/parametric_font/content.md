A parametric font is a variable font where one or more of its axes are parametric axes, such as Roboto Flex or Amstelvar. Unlike expressive variation axes like Weight and Width, parametric axes adjust attributes of typefaces that are detailed, measurable, and have values that can be reused across fonts.

Because many axis settings in parametric fonts result in visually unappealing fonts, it is recommended that users adjust parametric fonts by using the expressive variation axes first, then fine-tune using the parametric axes.
