“Regular” can refer to the regular [weight](/glossary/weight), usually assigned the `font-weight` value of 400 in CSS, or the regular/upright/roman (i.e., non-[italic](/glossary/italic) or [oblique](/glossary/oblique)) [style](/glossary/style) of a [typeface](/glossary/typeface).

When referring to this style it’s usually best to add clarity, by avoiding “regular” as a label on its own.
When the typeface is changing between a roman and italic (or upright and cursive, or oblique), say “regular roman”, “regular italic” or “regular upright”.
Note that in CSS, the style is referred to as “normal”; i.e., `font-style: normal;`.

“Regular” might also casually refer to type’s [width](/glossary/width) when there are [condensed](/glossary/condensed_narrow_compressed) or [wide](/glossary/wide_extended) variants available, although this is less often named explicitly, and then more often is called “normal” as in “regular normal roman” or “bold condensed italic”.
