A script (not to be confused with the [“script” classification](/glossary/script_typeface_style) of [typefaces](/glossary/typeface)) is a visual representation of verbal speech, and, when combined with a set of usage conventions (known as an orthography), is one of the main components of a [writing system](/glossary/writing_system).

Scripts can be used by one or more languages. For instance, although English, French, German, Norwegian, and Portuguese are distinct languages—with their own alphabets, conventions, and [diacritic](/glossary/diacritic_accent_marks) usage—they all use the [Latin](/glossary/latin) script.

Other scripts include [Greek](/glossary/greek_script) (upon which Latin is based), [Cyrillic](/glossary/cyrillic) (originally based on uppercase Greek forms), Arabic, Korean, Indic scripts from South and South East Asia, Han characters, and the traditional scripts of Africa.
