The stroke is one of the main lines that make up the appearance of a [character](/glossary/character). The term is derived from the penmanship inherent in hand [lettering](/glossary/lettering)—and is therefore more metaphorical when talking about [type](/glossary/type).

When we talk about [contrast](/glossary/contrast) in a [typeface](/glossary/typeface) (or [lettering](/glossary/lettering) or [calligraphy](/glossary/calligraphy)), we’re referring to the difference between the thinnest parts and thickest parts of the stroke.
