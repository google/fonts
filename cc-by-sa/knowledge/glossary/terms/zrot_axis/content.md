“Rotation in Z” (`ZROT` in CSS) is an [axis](/glossary/axis_in_variable_fonts) found in some [variable fonts](/glossary/variable_fonts) that can be used to alter the letterforms so that they appear to rotate in the Z dimension, giving the impression that they can interact in a three-dimensional space.

The [Google Fonts CSS v2 API](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/css2) defines the axis as:

| Default: | Min: | Max: | Step: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | -180 | 180 | 1 |

The specimen in the middle shows the effects of the axis’ default value. The specimen on the right shows the effects of the axis’ highest value.](images/thumbnail.svg)

Leaving the axis at its default value of 0 results in the character appearing face-on; manipulating it to its minimum value results in it appearing to rotate to the left; manipulating it to its maximum value results in it appearing to rotate to the right.

It may be used in conjunction with other axes controlling Y-transparencies (vertical alignment zones), especially the [Parametric Uppercase Height axis](/glossary/ytuc_axis) (`YTUC`) and [Parametric Descender Depth axis](/glossary/ytde_axis) (`YTDE`).
