excerpt: "Size wise, typefaces have a long history of small families: Style-wise, many sizes of metal type gave way to digital systems of multiple masters for various resolutions. Then came a flourishing of families with a broad range of styles and few size masters in PostScript, followed by OpenType continuing the PostScript tradition. And then, finally, variable fonts."
