There are four big differences in rules of typesetting between Latin and CJK fonts. 


## #1. Full-width, monospaced

Latin fonts are mostly proportional by default, but most CJK fonts are monospaced. Chinese and Japanese fonts are designed to fit in the [em](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/em)box, in other words “full-width.” Some Japanese fonts have smaller width for narrower typesetting, but the default of Japanese fonts is monospaced. Korean fonts are little more complicated—Hangeul, the Korean script, is designed monospaced by default, but the punctuations are proportional because they use Latin punctuations and also wordspacing system (more on that in **#3 Balance of the type—center of gravity, instead of the baseline)**. While Chinese and Japanese monospaced fonts are usually full-width, a recent trend in Korea is to make the letter width narrow, around 850~950 units, for smoother readability and smarter looks.

## #2. Use of punctuation

CJK scripts have a special punctuation in common called “full-width punctuation.” This is used in all CJK fonts, but the usages differ among them. 

In Japanese, full-width punctuation is used by default, and don’t use Latin punctuations unless in special cases, such as dissertation papers.

In Chinese, both Latin and full-width punctuations are used, but in Hong Kong and Taiwan with Traditional Chinese, commas are placed in the middle of the letter height. Latin punctuation and full-width punctuations are all used in a different meaning and purpose.

In Korean, the default punctuation is Latin, and no full-width punctuations. Only for brackets, the full-width punctuations are allowed but in limited special scenes. For example, when noting bibliography and references, both 「」and『』are being used from full-width punctuation. However, commas and periods are strictly Latin (shape-wise), and full-width punctuations are never used in that position. And for the wordspaces and Latin punctuations, most Korean fonts have a Korean version of it with a better size and baseline, because using Latin punctuation as it is does not fit with Hangeul well; they are not aligned well.

## #3. Balance of the type—center of gravity, instead of the baseline

CJK fonts do not have a concept of baseline. The idea is that the balance of the type exists roughly in the center of the embox, or letter box, if the font is proportional, and try to find the right center of gravity depending on the design of the font and the writing direction. Usually the balance is set in the center, but sometimes gravity shifts up and down. Usually when the gravity is high, the font is likely to look more sophisticated and elegant, and when it’s low, more casual.

## #4. No italic

In CJK scripts and fonts, there are no italics. They occasionally forcibly oblique the font for design purposes, but originally, italics do not exist. Instead, they come up with creative solutions. Most of the time, single and double quotation marks or full-width brackets are the common and easy way used to indicate emphasis. Little dots on top of the letters are also used a lot, but only when there is no Ruby. Underlines are also used but more for the subtitles than emphasis in the middle of the paragraph. If the design allows, wavy or highlighted underlines are also used. Bold or coloring the words are preferred solutions too.
