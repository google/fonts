#Tsume (Proportional Metrics)

Also known as "palt" in OpenType feature name. When you set up Tsume or turn on the Proportional Metrics, whitespace on both sides of the letter shrinks for tighter looking typesetting. Type designer defines the Tsume value when designing the font, and you can't change the Tsume value from OTF even with OFL fonts, but only from the source file.
