As we develop and experience more sophisticated augmented reality and virtual reality (AR/VR) applications, the introduction of more features and functions increases the complexity of information in front of the reader. Our existing typographic rules are not sufficient to address these new variables.

The careful consideration of typography in this new medium doesn’t end with dimensionality. How does text behave when we’re looking at it? Does it follow our head movements, or is it fixed somewhere in the 3D space? How does it behave when we’re looking at it from an angle? Does it have to be stationary, or should it move with our gaze? Should these behaviors be different if the user is moving? **(This is discussed in detail in article 4)**

In AR/VR, texts are no longer experienced in a static form. Movement, rotation, and rendering factors (frame rate, resolution) create challenges for text display like perspective distortion, distance reading, distortion of letter shapes, etc. Some of these challenges are not new at all, but the three-dimensional medium changes the context and introduces new complexities. For example, learnings from highway signages typography can be applied to scenarios where we want to convey quick information to a user wearing AR glasses while walking on the road. In this case, directly translating the guidelines might not work well enough because there are limitations in text rendering, the brightness of displays, the contrast of letters and their background, and so on. This is where typography for AR/VR has to evolve and solve these novel challenges.

Working in a three-dimensional AR/VR space might entice you to go fully 3D by adding depth to your text. It might feel like the right thing to do, but it has severe consequences on its utility. However, two-dimensional or flat text is recommended when it comes to longer paragraphs and sentences over 3D text. (See the image below.)

In fact, depth in text hinders both readability and legibility. It adds to the letter shapes, intervenes with the space between them, and, in certain situations, may make letters unrecognizable, requiring extra effort from the user to read the text. This problem is amplified if the user is looking at the text from an angle.

Text in AR/VR can use variable fonts to create responsive, spatial typography for a wide array of solutions. For example:

- The legibility of text outdoors can be improved by increasing the weight or grade axis to create enough contrast with the background
- Perspective distortion can corrected with the width axis
- The space between letters and their width can be optimized for text  seen from an angle by defining a new axis for fitting (spacing). This can also make sure adjacent letters don’t overlap.

The number of challenges will increase exponentially with the complexity of the texts we view and interact with in AR/VR, and variable fonts can address some of these.

Here are some quick tips:

- Keep 3D text limited to headings, or strings of text.
- Use 2D text for sentences and paragraphs.
- If 3D text is absolutely necessary, adjust the letter spacing to ensure legibility

Ensure that the difference in color on the face of your text vs depth provides enough contrast against its depth to aid legibility.At the time of writing, typography in AR/VR applications is in the early stages of development **(read more about it in our next article)**, and it will take time to reach the level of typographic refinement we’re used to on the web. However, considering these new possibilities will help us prepare for what’s next in the evolution of wearable technology.
