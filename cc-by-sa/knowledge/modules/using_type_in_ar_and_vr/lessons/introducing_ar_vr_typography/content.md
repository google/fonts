The world of typography is constantly evolving and adapting to technological advances. Within the realm of digital rendering, typography graduated from fuzzy letters on bulky CRT tubes to crystal-clear text on high-resolution screens. Similarly, the medium through which we consume the text has shrunk in form factor, from bulky desktops to handheld devices.

And now, the next transition is arriving, with the immersive worlds of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), where digital experiences extend beyond a flat, two-dimensional world. Instead, we interact with text in the three-dimensional space around us. Augmented reality enhances our experience by adding digital layers on top of the real world. Virtual reality is about fully immersive, computer-generated digital experiences that may or may not be related to the real world.

Text is an integral part of these experiences. During the initial years of AR/VR, creators did their best to use as little text as possible, due to the challenge of ensuring readability at the resolution and processing power of early devices. However, the complexity of information in immersive experiences is growing, and the need for text is rising with it.

How is text in AR/VR different to text in any other digital experience? In printed media, we have full control over the surfaces where our text is being read. On the web, we have learned to work within the constraints of responsive surfaces. Now with AR, we will have to design text that is readable and legible in countless scenarios **(article 4)**. One of the biggest challenges is unpredictable backgrounds: We might read the text using AR glasses while sitting in front of a blank wall, or in a busy cafe with people moving around. If the letterforms cannot stand out against the background, we won’t be able to read them.

As we traverse through these new mediums, we’re no longer just thinking about size (height and width) but also depth—where in the three-dimensional world does our text live? But that doesn't mean adding depth to our text solves our problems. Instead, it brings up numerous readability and legibility issues (we discuss these in detail in the next article).

There are additional technical challenges, like halation (excess glow around the text), limited resolution, distortion, chromatic aberration, vibrating text, etc. The list of challenges doesn’t end here: If the reader is moving, the text is also moving; and then the text could be viewed at an angle.

A series of studies conducted by [Gabbard et al](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/25504/pres%252E2006%252E15%252E1%252E16.pdf?sequence=1) and [Fiorentino et al](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274013793_Legibility_in_Industrial_AR_Text_Style_Color_Coding_and_Illuminance) in an industrial context tested variables like text style (background of text), color coding, and illumination. Their findings suggest the use of white text in billboard style (a rectangular block behind the text) works well in a variety of conditions. They also showed the positive impact of using a thin outline around the type for better contrast. Another study revealed the relationship between type size and contrast threshold; the smaller text requires higher contrast between text and the background for acceptable readability.

While AR/VR might conjure ideas of video games and entertainment, devices are already being used in critical domains such as industrial maintenance, construction, military hardware, and medical applications. These are highly sensitive areas, where slight errors can be life-threatening. This shift towards text-rich interfaces makes it essential to focus on legibility and readability. For example, in an industrial setting, a small mistake in reading boiler pressure can lead to a catastrophe.

With time, some of AR/VR’s limitations will be resolved, but how text is experienced in these environments may well represent a shift far greater than the transition from printed books to desktop screens. Starting to think about these issues now will help us shape engaging, effective, and safe reading experiences in this new medium.
