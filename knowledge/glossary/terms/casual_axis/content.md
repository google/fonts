“Casual” (CASL in CSS) is an axis found in some variable fonts. Along this axis, letterforms adjust from a more serious style to a more casual style, in a manner determined by the type designer. This can mean adjustments in stroke curvature, contrast, and terminals to go from a sturdy, rational “linear” style to a friendly, energetic “casual” style.
The Google Fonts CSS v2 API defines the axis as:

Default: 0     Min: 0     Max: 1     Step: 0.01

<figure>

![ALT_TEXT](images/thumbnail.svg)
<figcaption>CAPTION</figcaption>

</figure>

In line with the current CSS spec, all custom axes should be referenced in UPPERCASE (only the officially registered variable axes should appear in lowercase). Also, when using the Google Fonts API, the uppercase axes must appear first in the URL.
