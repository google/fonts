A character is a single unit of language, such as a letter or [punctuation](/lesson/exploring_punctuation) mark. The term is closely related to—but not the same as—a [glyph](/glossary/glyph).

Every [font](/glossary/font) has a Unicode character map that links (abstract) character IDs with how to display that character, using the default glyphs.

A line above the two glyphs links them together, showing that both glyphs represent the same character. Separate lines, below each, are grayed out.](images/thumbnail.svg)

While the two terms are sometimes interchangeable when talking about [type](/glossary/type), a single character can have multiple glyphs (see [alternates](/glossary/alternates)), and a single glyph can represent multiple characters (see [ligatures](/glossary/ligature)).

And, even for scenarios where a single character relates to a single glyph, it’s important to note that the character is the abstract concept; the glyph is what we use.
