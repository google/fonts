“Display” means type intended for large sizes. When referring to [optical sizing](/glossary/optical_sizes), Display is a counterpart to [Body](/glossary/body) and represents stylistic differences that make a Display variant more suitable to being set at large sizes, such as greater [stroke](/glossary/stroke) [contrast](/glossary/contrast) and tighter [spacing](/glossary/tracking_letter_spacing).

Display can also be used as a catch-all term for a loose grouping of decorative [typefaces](/glossary/typeface), which can be a useful genre [classification](/glossary/classification) when choosing [fonts](/glossary/font) from a large library. These are faces that are only ever intended for large sizes, usually due to genre, decoration, or fine detail.
