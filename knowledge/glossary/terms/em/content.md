An em is a [unit](/glossary/unit) of measurement, relative to the size of the [font](/glossary/font); therefore, in a [typeface](/glossary/typeface) set at a `font-size` of 16px, one em is 16px.

The em square is the “box” that each [glyph](/glossary/glyph) is sized relative to. So, at 12 points, the em square is 12 points wide. The boundary of the box sits slightly above the cap-height and slightly below the descender.

The [em dash](/glossary/dashes) is so named because its width, in theory, is one em—although in most fonts the em dash is somewhat narrower. An [*en* dash](/glossary/en) takes up approximately half the space of an em square.

Historically, the em unit itself was named after the width of the capital M, although this is no longer the case; in any digital font, the M may be wider or narrower than the em box of that font.
