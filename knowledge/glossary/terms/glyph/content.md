A glyph is a single representation of a [character](/glossary/character). Every [font](/glossary/font) has a [Unicode](/glossary/unicode) character map that links (abstract) character IDs with how to display that character, using the default glyphs.

A single glyph takes up one space in a font’s glyph table—a database that sits inside a font file, organized in a standardized way according to Unicode recommendations.

A line below each of the two shows that they are individual glyphs. A single line, above, is not highlighted, and represents “character."](images/thumbnail.svg)

While “glyph“ and “character” are sometimes interchangeable when talking about [type](/glossary/type), a single character can have multiple glyphs (see [alternates](/glossary/alternates)), and a single glyph can represent multiple characters (see [ligatures](/glossary/ligature)).

And, even for scenarios where a single character relates to a single glyph, it’s important to note that the character is the abstract concept; the glyph is what we use.
