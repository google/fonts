Greek script is the writing system used for the Greek language. It should not be confused with the erroneously used “Greek” [placeholder text](/glossary/placeholder_text).

![A Greek text specimen set in four different typefaces. The text reads “Μια νέα και συναρπαστική λήψη της παραδοσιακής κουζίνας στο κέντρο της πόλης”, which in English translates as, “A new and exciting take on traditional cuisine in the city center.” ](images/thumbnail.svg)

The first [typefaces](/glossary/typeface) for the Greek script appeared in the 15th century. The [lowercase](/glossary/uppercase_lowercase) letters closely followed key scribal hands of the period, while the capitals retained their inscriptional roots. Over time Greek typefaces evolved to maintain elements of their cursive roots in the lowercase, while developing a wider range of typographically appropriate forms.

The original [Cyrillic script](/glossary/cyrillic) was based on uppercase Greek [letterforms](/glossary/letterform).
