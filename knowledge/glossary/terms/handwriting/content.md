Handwriting is the act of writing by the human hand, usually with a pen or pencil, in a casual manner (unlike the decorative nature of [calligraphy](/glossary/calligraphy) or [lettering](/glossary/lettering)). “Handwriting” or “handwritten” may also refer to a loose genre classification of [typefaces](/glossary/typeface): those resembling a handwritten style.

Note that there’s a large crossover between the “handwriting” and “[script](/glossary/script_typeface_style)” genres of typeface [classification](/glossary/classification). Examples of handwritten typefaces include [Kalam](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kalam?category=Handwriting) and [Tillana](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tillana?category=Handwriting&query=Indian+Type+Foundry#standard-styles).
