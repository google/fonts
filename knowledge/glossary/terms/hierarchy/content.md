Hierarchy refers to the overall structure of a document and the relationship between elements within the text. A heading placed above a paragraph gives meaning and context to that paragraph, and implies a hierarchy to the text as a whole. Different levels of headings (in HTML, h1, h2, h3, etc.) further delineate hierarchy within sections of the text.

As typographers, our role is to further enhance the meaning and understanding of a textâ€™s hierarchy by applying suitable typographic treatments to each element.
