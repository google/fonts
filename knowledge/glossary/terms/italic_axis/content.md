Italic (ital in CSS) is an axis found in some variable fonts. It controls the font file’s italic parameter, with italics either turned “off” or “on”, rather than gradually changing over a range.

The Google Fonts CSS v2 API defines the axis as:

Default: 0     Min: 0     Max: 1     Step: 0.1

<figure>

![ALT_TEXT](images/thumbnail.svg)
<figcaption>CAPTION</figcaption>

</figure>

Italic is a type style that’s almost always slanted and is designed to create emphasis in text. Originally based on semi-cursive forms, italics are a direct contrast to the upright style. Unlike obliques, which are slanted versions of the upright forms, italics have a different structure informed by cursive handwriting—with their own nuances.

Because most italic forms are slanted, for variable fonts, the italic axis and the slant axis are very closely related. For detailed descriptions on how to use both, please see our “Styling type on the web with variable fonts” lesson.
