Italic (`ital` in CSS) is an [axis](/glossary/axis_in_variable_fonts) found in some [variable fonts](/glossary/variable_fonts). It controls the [font](/glossary/font) file’s [italic](/glossary/italic) parameter, with italics either turned “off” or “on”, rather than gradually changing over a range.

The [Google Fonts CSS v2 API ](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/css2) defines the axis as:

| Default: 0 | Min: 0 | Max: 1 | Step: 0.1 |

The first specimen, with the switch to the left, uses upright or regular forms. The second specimen, with the switch to the right, uses italic forms.](images/thumbnail.svg)

Italic is a [type](/glossary/type) [style](/glossary/style) that’s almost always slanted and is designed to create emphasis in [text](/glossary/text). Originally based on semi-cursive forms, italics are a direct contrast to the [upright](/glossary/regular_upright) style. Unlike [obliques](/glossary/oblique), which are slanted versions of the upright forms, italics have a different structure informed by cursive [handwriting](/glossary/handwriting)—with their own nuances.

Because most italic forms are slanted, for variable fonts, the italic axis and the [slant axis](/glossary/slant_axis) are very closely related. For detailed descriptions on how to use both, please see our [“Styling type on the web with variable fonts”](/lesson/styling_type_on_the_web_with_variable_fonts) article.
