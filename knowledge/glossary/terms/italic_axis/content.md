Italic (`ital` in CSS) is an [axis](/glossary/axis_in_variable_fonts) found in some [variable fonts](/glossary/variable_fonts). It controls the [font](INSERT_URL) file’s [italic](INSERT_URL) parameter, with italics either turned “off” or “on”, rather than gradually changing over a range.

The [Google Fonts CSS v2 API ](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/css2) defines the axis as:

Default: 0     Min: 0     Max: 1     Step: 0.1

<figure>

![ALT_TEXT](images/thumbnail.svg)
<figcaption>CAPTION</figcaption>

</figure>

Italic is a [type](INSERT_URL) [style](INSERT_URL) that’s almost always slanted and is designed to create emphasis in [text](INSERT_URL). Originally based on semi-cursive forms, italics are a direct contrast to the [upright](INSERT_URL) style. Unlike [obliques](INSERT_URL), which are slanted versions of the upright forms, italics have a different structure informed by cursive [handwriting](INSERT_URL)—with their own nuances.

Because most italic forms are slanted, for variable fonts, the italic axis and the [slant axis](INSERT_URL) are very closely related. For detailed descriptions on how to use both, please see our [“Styling type on the web with variable fonts”](INSERT_URL) lesson.
