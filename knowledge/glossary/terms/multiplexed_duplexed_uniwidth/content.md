A multiplexed/duplexed/uniwidth [typeface](/glossary/typeface) is one in which each of its [weights](/glossary/weight) takes up exactly the same horizontal space. This is unlike most typefaces, where increasing font weight will usually result in that type taking up more space.

![The phrase “Occupancy remains the same” set in five different weights of a sans serif typeface on five different lines. Despite the different weights, the horizontal space of the characters remains the same on each line. Vertical lines at the start of each word in the sentence highlight the consistent spacing.](images/thumbnail.svg)

Multiplexed faces can be useful to employ in scenarios where [font](/glossary/font) weights are often switched, such as in screen-based design, where a button might switch to a heavier weight when hovered. Maintaining the same horizontal spacing means the button size can stay the same in both states.
