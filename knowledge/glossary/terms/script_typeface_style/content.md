Script is a genre classification for [typefaces](/glossary/typeface) that take direct influence from [handwriting](/glossary/handwriting) and [calligraphy](/glossary/calligraphy). While there’s the potential for crossover with the “handwritten” sub-genre, most script [type](/glossary/type) is slightly more formal in its composition and is decorated with numerous flourishes.
