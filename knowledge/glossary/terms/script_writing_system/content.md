A script is a collective way of describing a writing system used by multiple languages (and shouldn’t be confused with the “script” classification of typefaces). For instance, although English, French, German, Norwegian, and Portuguese are distinct languages—with their own alphabets, conventions, and diacritic usage—they all use the Latin script.

Other writing systems include Greek (upon which Latin is based), Cyrillic (originally based on uppercase Greek forms), Arabic, Korean, Indic scripts South and South East Asia, Han characters, and the traditional scripts of Africa.

The combination of a script and a set of conventions for a particular language is referred to as an orthography.
