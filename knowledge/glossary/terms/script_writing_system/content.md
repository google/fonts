A script is a collective way of describing a writing system used by multiple languages (and shouldn’t be confused with the [“script” classification](INSERT_URL) of [typefaces](INSERT_URL)). For instance, although English, French, German, Norwegian, and Portuguese are distinct languages—with their own alphabets, conventions, and [diacritic](INSERT_URL) usage—they all use the [Latin](INSERT_URL) script.

Other writing systems include [Greek](INSERT_URL) (upon which Latin is based), [Cyrillic](INSERT_URL) (originally based on uppercase Greek forms), Arabic, Korean, Indic scripts South and South East Asia, Han characters, and the traditional scripts of Africa.

The combination of a script and a set of conventions for a particular language is referred to as an orthography.
