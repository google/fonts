Slant (slnt in CSS) is an [axis](/glossary/axis_in_variable_fonts) found in some [variable fonts](/glossary/variable_fonts). It controls the font file’s slant parameter for oblique styles. 

The [Google Fonts CSS v2 API ](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/css2) defines the axis as:

Default: 0     Min: -90     Max: 90     Step: 1

<figure>

![ALT_TEXT](images/thumbnail.svg)
<figcaption>CAPTION</figcaption>

</figure>

Oblique characters follow the structure of the upright styles, while italics have a different structure, typically informed by cursive writing. Obliques are not necessarily merely digitally slanted—optical corrections are often made to avoid distortions and an incorrect distribution of weight. Generally, obliques are less common than italics.

For variable fonts, the italic axis and the slant axis are very closely related. For detailed descriptions on how to use both, please see our “Styling type on the web with variable fonts” article.
