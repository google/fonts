Slant (`slnt` in CSS) is an [axis](/glossary/axis_in_variable_fonts) found in some [variable fonts](/glossary/variable_fonts). It controls the [font](INSERT_URL) file’s [slant](INSERT_URL) parameter for [oblique](INSERT_URL) [styles](INSERT_URL).

The [Google Fonts CSS v2 API ](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/css2) defines the axis as:

| Default: 0 | Min: -90 | Max: 90 | Step: 1 |

![Two side-by-side type specimens of the word phrase “lean-to”, each shown with a variable axis represented beneath as a horizontal slider. The first specimen, with the slider most of the way to the right to represent a higher value on the axis, shows upright forms. The second specimen, with the slider more to the left to represent a low-to-mid value on the axis, shows more slanted forms.](images/thumbnail.svg)

Oblique [characters](INSERT_URL) follow the structure of the [upright](INSERT_URL) styles, while [italics](INSERT_URL) have a different structure, typically informed by cursive [writing](INSERT_URL). Obliques are not necessarily merely [digitally slanted](INSERT_URL)—optical corrections are often made to avoid distortions and an incorrect distribution of weight. Generally, obliques are less common than italics.

For variable fonts, the [italic axis](INSERT_URL) and the slant axis are very closely related. For detailed descriptions on how to use both, please see our [“Styling type on the web with variable fonts”](INSERT_URL) article.
