A superfamily is the collective grouping of several explicitly related [type](/glossary/type) [families](/glossary/family_or_type_family_or_font_family)—such as a [serif](/glossary/serif), [sans](/glossary/sans_serif), and [slab](/glossary/slab_serif_egyptian_clarendon)—that all share the same underlying structure to their design.

It’s common for a [typeface](/glossary/typeface) to be made up of several variants—usually [weight](/glossary/weight)s—and this is referred to as a “family.” When the variants are more plentiful, especially when the family includes variants across typeface genres (e.g. serif and sans), it can be referred to as a “superfamily.” Variable fonts make it possible to deploy an entire superfamily as a single font file.

Examples of superfamilies include Source ([Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro), [Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+Pro), [Code](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro)), IBM Plex ([Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans), [Sans Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans+Condensed), [Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Serif), [Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono)), and Roboto ([Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto), [Sans Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed), [Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab), [Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono)).
