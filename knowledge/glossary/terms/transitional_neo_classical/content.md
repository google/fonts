Transitional or Neo-classical (sometimes stylized as Neoclassical) is a historical [classification](/glossary/classification) for [typefaces](/glossary/typeface) that reference elements of human penmanship—à la [Humanist](/glossary/humanist_old_style) faces. But they do so in a more ordered and structured form, usually with a higher [stroke](/glossary/stroke) [contrast](/glossary/contrast), a more upright [axis](/glossary/axis_in_type_design), and more symmetry. Didone (or Modern) faces are often interchangeable with this grouping, too, although they usually exhibit an even greater stroke contrast.

It’s important to note that, like all historical classifications, transitional typefaces that fit this style don’t necessarily come from this period in history. Examples of transitional typefaces include [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather), [PT Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Serif?query=pt+serif), and—on the Didone end of the spectrum—[Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display).
