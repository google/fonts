A [type](/glossary/type) designer is someone who designs typefaces. This should not be confused with a [typographer](/glossary/typographer)—someone who designs *with* typefaces.

[Type foundries](/glossary/type_foundry) are businesses made up of at least one type designer with the purpose of selling their [fonts](/glossary/font). It’s not uncommon for foundries to be run by a single type designer.
