A type foundry is an organization that publishes [typefaces](/glossary/typeface) and releases [fonts](/glossary/font). Foundries are almost always formed by a [type designer](/glossary/type_designer)—and it’s not uncommon for a type foundry to be the work of one single type designer.

The term "foundry" comes from the traditional idea of a foundry, when type was cast in metal.
