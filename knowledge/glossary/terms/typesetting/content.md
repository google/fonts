Typesetting is the act of setting [type](/glossary/type); that is, arranging [characters](/glossary/character) and making informed [typographic decisions](/glossary/typography) that will optimize the [readability](/glossary/legibility_readability) of that [text](/glossary/text_copy).

In the pre-digital age, typesetting was a complicated process that could only be completed by highly trained individuals using expensive hardware—a sharp contrast with today, where anyone with any sort of computing device can set type with ease. As such, we have no excuse not to practice the art and science of typography—and guiding that practice is the aim of **Google Fonts Knowledge**.
