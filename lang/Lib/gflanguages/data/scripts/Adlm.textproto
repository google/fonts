summary: "Adlam (<span class=\'autonym\'>ðž¤€ðž¤£ðž¤¤ðž¤¢ðž¤¥ ðž¤†ðž¤µðž¤¤ðž¤¢ðž¤ª</span>) is an African bicameral alphabet, written right-to-left. Used for the Fulani (Fula, 65 million speakers) language in Guinea, which previously used Latin and Arabic. Created around 1989 by two teenage brothers, Ibrahima and Abdoulaye Barry. One of indigenous scripts for specific languages in West Africa, currently taught in Guinea, Nigeria, Liberia and other countries. Adlam has 28 letters, each in four forms. The unjoined variant is suitable for headlines and for educational content. The cursive variant, in which letters join the same way as in Arabic and Nâ€™Ko, is suitable for most texts. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping)."
