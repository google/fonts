summary: "Braille (<span class=\'autonym\'>⠃⠗⠇</span>) is an artificial alphabet, written left-to-right. A tactile writing system used by the visually impaired, traditionally written on embossed paper. Developed 1821 by Louis Braille, who lost his sight at age three. Inspired by Charles Barbier’s night writing code developed for silent military communication. Each sign is a combination of six raised or lowered dots. All 64 combinations stand for Latin letters, common abbreviations and words, and a space. Used for languages that use the Latin script or have a Latin transcription convention."
