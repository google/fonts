summary: "Korean Hanja (<span class=\'autonym\'>한자, 漢字</span>) is an East Asian logo-syllabary, written left-to-right. Based on traditional Chinese Han characters, Hanja was used for the Korean language until 1446, when King Sejong introduced Hangul. Until the mid-20th century Hanja and Hangul were used in parallel or mixed. Today, the vast majority of Korean text uses Hangul but Hanja is still used in some context, and schools teach some 1,000-3,000 Hanja symbols."
