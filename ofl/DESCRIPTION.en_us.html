<p><strong>Fantoms</strong> is a retro display font inspired by 1950s/60s music posters and band lettering. It was created for The Fantoms by Gary Daggers from original drawings, then digitised for public release.</p>
<p>Fantoms is ideal for music branding, show cards, vintage promo art, and titles that need a lively rock’n’roll feel.</p>
