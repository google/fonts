Abhaya Libre is a serif typeface that echoes ‘FM Abhaya’ – an interpretation of the Sinhala letterpress typefaces from 1960s. 
The name ‘Abhaya’ is derived from the King Abhaya (474 BCE to 454 BCE) who reigned Sri Lanka from the ancient kingdom of Upatissa Nuwara.

Abhaya Libre enables designers to build sophisticated typographic layouts by using lighter weights for body text and heavier weights for 
headlines and subheadings. Each of these weights contains 925 glyphs that enables clean and precise rendering for Sinhala, Pali and Sanskrit texts. 
Good choice for editorial and publication needs.
