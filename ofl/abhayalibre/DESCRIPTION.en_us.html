Abhaya Libre is an opentype web font family consisting of five weights that supports the Sinhala and Latin scripts. Extensive ligatures and conjuncts render not only the Sinhala language, but also the litugurical Pali language making the typefamily usable for a range of typesetting purposes. The Latin is designed to work harmoniously with the Sinhala design. The Sinhala design of the Abhaya Libre is based on FM Abhaya, a typeface designed by Pushpananda Ekanayake, 1996. FM Abhaya has ever since been the defacto text typeface in Sinhala.
