<p>Aboreto is a display typeface based on early renaissance majuscule alphabet done by Luca della Robbia, a 15th century Florentine sculptor. The typeface is not a straightforward digitalization (it even couldn’t be as the early Latin alphabet didn’t include all the letters we use today) but more of a revival which keeps current needs and technologies in mind.</p>

<p>Aboreto has vertical stress, a feature more typical of later-century typefaces. Another uniqueness lies in the construction, because it is essentially a sans-serif typeface that has only occasional indication of serifs – either via the “hidden” serifs caused by stroke tapering or by slightly thickening the stroke endings.

Aboreto comes in one weight - a high contrast regular that is on the thinner side.</p>
