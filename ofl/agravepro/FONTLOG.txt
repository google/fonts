1. General Information

Agràve Pro is a carefully crafted, cheerful script typeface, designed especially for setting large bodies of text. With its open counters, short ascenders and descenders, consistent stroke width, and over 6,500 kerning pairs, it offers outstanding readability.

The Agràve font family includes three weights: Light, Regular and Bold. It features 783 glyphs, an extensive set of ligatures, and full multilingual support. Every accented character is uniquely drawn, adding subtle variation and character. The family also includes a complete set of multilingual small caps and an impressive range of numeral styles—lining, oldstyle, tabular, fractions, and scientific inferiors.

- Included multilingual support, small caps, and numeral variations.

July 22, 2020 - Version 1.001

- Repeatedly ran FontBakery checks to confirm that all critical FAILs were resolved.
- Ensured the font family is compliant with Google Fonts technical requirements.

- Ensured vertical metrics are consistent across all styles (Light, Regular, Bold).
- Added a proper OFL.txt license file

- Ensured ligature caret positions are correctly compiled into the GDEF table, resolving caret-related warnings.
- Removed the Soft Hyphen (U+00AD)
- Added a dotted circle glyph (U+25CC) to support proper display of combining marks.
- Added appropriate mark anchors so that all combining marks can correctly attach to the dotted circle.
- Verified combining mark behavior in shaping engines (e.g. TextEdit).
- Removed or excluded unreachable glyphs that were not accessible via Unicode or OpenType substitutions.
- Cleaned up redundant ligature variants that were not referenced by features.
- Ensured correct style linking between Regular and Bold using proper weight classes and the Bold Style parameter.
