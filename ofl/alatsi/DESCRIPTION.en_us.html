<p>Alatsi is an original typeface designed by Spyros Zevelakis.</p>
<p>It is a semicondensed geometric sans design which feels familiar, calm, trustable and contemporary. It is a little lighthearted or casual in feeling as well. The contemporary feeling comes from the treatment of the terminals and the cheekily pointed V A W. The calmness from the modest x height.</p>

<p>Alatsi offers a wide range of figures which include oldstyle figures, numerators, denominators and fractions. It also offers case sensitive forms.</p>

<p>Latest upgrade from November 2022 includes a Latin Plus language coverage currently supporting most Latin-based languages.</p>
