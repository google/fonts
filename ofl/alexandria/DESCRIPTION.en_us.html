    Alexandria is a 9 weights font family made in matching to the Latin <a
        href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat">Montserrat</a> by Julieta Ulanovsky which was
    inspired by the old posters and signs in the traditional Montserrat neighborhood of Buenos Aires.

    Having the font family of nine weights increases the ability to use the font in various applications, from long text
    using the light weights to short headlines using the heavy thick weights.
