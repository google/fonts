Basic Font Information

Alfa Slab One is a contemporary take on the Six-lines 
Pica Egyptian created by Robert Thorne for the Thorowgood 
Foundry in 1921. Although initially based on that 
model, Alfa Slab One was designed with an extreme stem 
weight, big serifs, more stem contrast and gradual 
terminals with a single serif. All this attributes 
give Alfa Slab One a contemporary look with extreme 
black density.
