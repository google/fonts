<p>Alike Angular is a complementary titling style to <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Alike">Alike</a>. It shares the same proportions as its counterpart for compatibility, and is designed for larger display sizes.</p>
<p>As opposed to the soft Regular, its letterforms consist of only straight splines. Additional expressive features are introduced in characters like T, Z, M, E.</p>

<p>Designed by Sveta Sebyakina in 2009, and in collaboration with Alexei Vanyashin it was first released in 2011 by Cyreal.</p>
