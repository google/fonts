<p>
    A display typeface family comprising of Bangla, Devanagari, Odia and Latin
</p>
<p>
    Each typeface for each script has been designed keeping in mind the inspiration of drawing letters for wall
    graffitis in Bengal, India, by using a stick and tar. The forms have blobby blackness to it and have been designed
    for mostly display purposes.
</p>
<p>
    The design and idea has been spearheaded by Suman Bhandary. The Latin has been crafted by Lewis McGuffie.
    Special thanks to Nehal Mathews and Lopamudra Bose for their assistance in Odia and Devanagari.
