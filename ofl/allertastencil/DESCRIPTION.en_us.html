Allerta Stencil is the stencil version of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Allerta">Allerta</a>. 
It was initially developed for use in signage, designed to be easily and quickly read from a distance. 
Each glyph exploits the unique aspects of the individual letter so that each can be easily distinguished from any other.
