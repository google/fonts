    Amarna is a semi-glyphic humanist sans-serif typeface, taking inspiration from the cold sophistication of early humanist sans- and glyphic serifs such as Gill Sans or Albertus, while attempting to bring the traits which define those typefaces in line with the principles of modern sans-serif type design. Amarna is amicable and easy to read in small sizes, but takes on a much more glyphic, naturalistic quality when rendered in larger sizes, at lighter weights and especially in all-caps text. Amarna is a variable-weight font, with weights currently ranging from 100 (Hairline) to 700 (Bold).
