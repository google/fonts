<p> Anek, as the meaning of the word suggests, is an exercise in multiplicity — multiple scripts designed in multiple
    weights and widths by multiple designers. A well-informed, conscientious and refreshing interpretation of India’s
    letter traditions, this family offers a versatile system that can meet the demands of a wide range of applications.
</p>

<p> Its expansive design space allows Anek to don multiple personalities. At its most condensed, capsular forms keep
    structures compact for that graphic texture. On the wide end of the spectrum, the extra legroom lets each letter
    yawn and stretch into their message. But it is in the boldest weights that Anek comes alive. Sharp terminals and
    tapered joineries sparkle amidst regimented forms, making this ideal for setting titillating headlines or that
    magnetic word-mark.</p>

<p> Anek comes in <a href="/?query=Anek">ten scripts</a>: Bangla, Devanagari, Kannada, Latin, Gujarati, Gurmukhi,
    Malayalam, Odia, Tamil and Telugu. The shared aesthetics of this type-family are drawn from a collaboratively
    decided pool of visual features. At the same time, each script amalgamates influences from its own typographic
    culture as well as the perspectives of individual designers. </p>
