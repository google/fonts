A favorite of designer Kimberly Giswein, who after seeing a talented photography student write something down, 
squealed and begged for a sample of her writing as inspiration for this font. 
It was worth the effort as the student’s style translated into a cute font. 
She named the font as a nod to one of her favorite bands, Jack’s Mannequin.
