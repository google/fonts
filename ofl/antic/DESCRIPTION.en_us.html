Antic is the result of studying calligraphic forms, and is designed to be used for running text. 
This started two big text type family projects with this being the first one. 
Antic explores the use of sans-serif letterforms for text usage, keeping a calligraphic touch found in the serif counterpart, Clark. 
The letterforms have an eight degree stress, which is almost the same degree of the designer's hand writing.

There's also the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Antic+Slab">Antic Slab</a> and the 
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Antic+Didone">Antic Didone</a>
which gives the designer freedom to create rhythmic and dynamic typography using all three families in the type system.

The Antic Type System is in progress and is being regularly improved.
