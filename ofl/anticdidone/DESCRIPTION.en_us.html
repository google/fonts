Antic Didone was designed for use in the headlines of newspapers and magazines. 
The Antic Type System is a super family that is still evolving, and this is the first release of the Didone family. 
It complements the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Antic">Sans</a> and 
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Antic+Slab">Slab</a> versions, 
giving the designer freedom to create rhythmic and dynamic typography using all three families in the type system.

Each family in the type system has a large x-height that makes it very readable, especially on the web. 
Each also has slight stress derived from handwriting. Antic Didone's minuscule ornate serifs create a unique texture. 
With modern proportions and condensed letterforms, it is great for economical typesetting, on paper and on screen.

The Antic Type System is in progress and is being regularly improved.
