Anton is a reworking of a traditional advertising sans serif typeface. The
letter forms have been digitised and then reshaped for use as a webfont, the
counters have been opened up a little and the stems optimised for use as bold
display font in modern web browsers.

<p>
Anton language support includes now African Latin and full coverage of Vietnamese, additional to all Western, Central, and South-Eastern European languages.
