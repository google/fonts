<p>Antonio is a reworking of a traditional advertising sans serif typeface.
The letter forms have been digitised and then reshaped for use as a webfont,
the counters have been opened up a little and the stems optimised for use as
bold display font in modern web browsers.</p>

<p>Antonio was initially released as a single bold style, named 
<a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Anton">Anton</a>, and then
extended into a family in March 2013.</p>
