    Antonio is a 'refined' version of the Anton Font. Anton is a single weight web font, designed specifically for
    larger display, headline and 'banner' use (see Google's PR for the Chromebook notebooks that used Anton, big and
    bright).
</p>
<p>
    Antonio extends the Anton design to include more weights and introduces refinements to the design that makes it also
    suitable for use in smaller headings, menus and 'buttons' etc.
