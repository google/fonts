    Anuphan is a loopless version of IBM Plex Thai developed by Mint Tantisuwanna, a type designer at
    Cadson Demak. This project is intended for self-improvement/educational purpose.

    Note: This is not a modification of IBM Plex Sans Thai. All drawings and outlines of Thai characters in this project
    are based solely on the Latin version of IBM Plex Sans.
