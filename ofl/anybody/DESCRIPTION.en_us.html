<p>Anybody is a big family that combines an affinity for Eurostile plus a heavy dose of 90s inspiration. It's flexible enough to adapt to a variety of situations. From UltraCondensed to ExtraExpanded, type set in Anybody can take up a tiny amount of horizontal space or so much space that you'll need several lines. Its high x-height and low cap height help exaggerate extreme widths and weights. The italic angle is 10 degrees, noticable but subtle. The inclusion of some popular OpenType features make it practical and customizable.</p>
