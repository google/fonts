Arbutus is a sturdy, medium contrast, slab serif typeface with a faceted/spiked treatment inspired by American wood type. 
The generous spacing found in this design means that it can be used at fairly small sizes which makes it surprisingly versatile.
There is a sister family – <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arbutus+Slab">Arbutus Slab</a>.
