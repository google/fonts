<p>
Arizonia was inspired by the lettering found on a construction truck. It has a sign-painterly look with thick and then contrasts that resembles using a pointed brush. 
</p>
<p>
It can be used for situations that require a hand lettered, contemporary and sporty feel. As with any script, Arizonia should not be used in ALL Caps.
</p>
<p>
It comes with Latin Character sets including Western, Central, and Vietnamese language support.
