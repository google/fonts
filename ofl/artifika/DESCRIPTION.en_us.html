<p>Artifika is an amiable upright italic for fashionable display titling.</p>
<p>Overall features are tender and crisp, descenders short. Settled curves are sculpted with calligraphic elegance,
    instrokes have a widening as a tribute to it's broad-nib origin.</p>
<p>Nearly horizontal flat serifs support left-to-right direction, making the typeface pleasant for reading on screen.
