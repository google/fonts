<p>Artifika is an amiable upright italic for fashionable display titling.</p> <p>Overall features are tender and crisp, descenders short. Settled curves are sculpted with calligraphic elegance, instrokes have a widening as a tribute to it's broad-nib origin.</p> <p>Nearly horizontal flat serifs support left-to-right direction, making the typeface pleasant for reading on screen.</p> <p>Designed by Yulya Zhdanova, Ivan Petrov in 2010-2011.</p>
