Arvo is a geometric slab-serif typeface family suited for screen and print. 
The flavour of the font is rather mixed, being nearly monolinear to increase legibility. 
Arvo is an Estonian name for boys, not as widely used today. 
In the Finnish language, Arvo means "number, value, worth." Considering how much programming was involved in hinting it, that meaning is also relevant.
