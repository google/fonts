<p>Asap ("as soon as possible") is a contemporary sans-serif family with subtle rounded corners. This family, specially developed for screen and desktop use, offers a standarised character width on all styles, which means lines of text remain the same length. This useful feature allows users to change type styles on-the-go without reflowing a text body. </p>
<p>Asap has been upgraded to a variable font in 2021</p>
<p>Asap is based on Ancha (Pablo Cosgaya, Hector Gatti). It is designed by Pablo Cosgaya and Omnibus-Type Team, with the collaboration of Andr√©s Torresi. To contribute, see <a href="https://github.com/Omnibus-Type/Asap">github.com/Omnibus-Type/Asap</a>.</p>
