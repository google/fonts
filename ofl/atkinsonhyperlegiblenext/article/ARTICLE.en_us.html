<p>Atkinson Hyperlegible, named after the founder of the Braille Institute, has been developed specifically to increase legibility for readers with low vision, and to improve comprehension.</p>

<p>Having a traditional grotesque sans-serif at its core, it departs from tradition to incorporate unambiguous, distinctive elements—and at times, unexpected forms—always with the goal of increasing character recognition and ultimately improve reading.</p>

<p>Atkinson Hyperlegible Next is an improvement of the typeface Atkinson Hyperlegible, including new characters, improved glyphs, and improved kerning. Additionally, the two previous weights has increased to six, all in upright and italic, allowing for greater flexibility in use.</p>
