<p>Aubrey is a playful condensed decorative font with an art nouveau essence. Horizontal elements are unexpectedly cut and swapped with sloped curves creating off-beats in the overall rhythm. Spurs are added to twist and stress the movement. Aubrey can be a good choice for designing holiday decorations and greetings. Works best in medium sizes.</p> <p>Designed by Gayaneh Bagdasaryan.</p>
