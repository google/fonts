<p>Aubrey is a playful condensed decorative font with an art nouveau essence.
    Horizontal elements are unexpectedly cut and swapped with
    sloped curves creating off-beats in the overall rhythm.
    Spurs are added to twist and stress the movement.
    Aubrey can be a good choice for designing holiday
    decorations and greetings. Works best in medium and large sizes.</p>
