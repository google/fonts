<p>Audiowide is a sans serif, technology-styled typeface, composed of soft
corner tubular forms. With vague nods to letter styles like that of Handel
Gothic and the Converse logo, Audiowide veers off in a direction of its own for
a slightly more techno-futuristic and yet, cleanly readable typestyle.</p>
<p>Audiowide is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use the Latin script and
its variants, and could be expanded to support other scripts. To contribute to
