<p>Average Sans has the color, structure and proportions of its serif sister
family, <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Average">Average</a>,
which it complements harmoniously. The neutrality of the forms create a nice
texture, both for texts and short headlines. Use it for online magazines,
academic texts and blogs.</p>
