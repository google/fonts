B612 is the result of an Airbus initiated research collaboration with ENAC and Université de Toulouse III on a prospective study 
to define and validate an “Aeronautical Font”. 
</p>
<p>
It is a highly legible open source font family, designed and tested to be used on aircraft cockpit screens. 
Its design makes it particularly suitable for degraded contexts (ensuring legibility and readability of data),
with a positive effect on reducing visual fatigue and cognitive load. 
Particular attention was given to the uniformity of the typeface, whether being used for isolated terms, reading information on a map, 
mixing capital letters and numbers, waypoint lists, long or abbreviated texts, specific terms and data in the aeronautical field. 
B612 is a two-weight font family including roman and italic styles. It also has a monospaced variation, B612 Mono.
