Bakbak One is a custom brand typeface for All India Bakchod. Owing to its usage, it is a heavyweight display typeface for headings, video titles and posters. It consists of 1 weight and 692 glyphs and borrows from humanist ‘Johnston’ like arches. Bakbak is loud and present but also neutral enough to render anything from a warning to a mockery.
