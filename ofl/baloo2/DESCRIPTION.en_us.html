    A perfect blend of pointy paws in a coat of fur, Baloo is an affable display typeface by Ek Type.
    Available in nine Indian scripts plus Arabic along with a Latin counterpart, the family is Unicode compliant and
    libre licensed.

    Baloo 2 is an extension of the earlier Baloo project. The new Baloo 2 includes additional glyphs, engineering
    improvements, and has been extended to five weights, ranging from the light footed Regular to the affable ExtraBold.
    The lighter weights retain Baloo’s characteristic bounce, but they do so slightly, infusing life into each word.
    This allows the new family to freely fraternise with texts of all sizes and temperaments — be it short bursts or
    copious reams, demanding headlines or whispering bylines. Carefree yet confident, sprightly yet versatile, the
    renewed family of Baloo promises to bring warmth to every project.

    The Baloo 2 project consists of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=baloo">ten font families</a> with unique
    local names for each of the nine Indic scripts plus Arabic (Baloo Bhaijaan 2). Each family supports one
    Indic/Arabic script plus Latin, Latin Extended, and Vietnamese.

    It took a team of committed type designers to rear Baloo and raise it to be the typeface we love. The Gurmukhi is
    designed by Shuchita Grover; Bangla by Noopur Datye and Sulekha Rajkumar; Odia by Yesha Goshar, Manish Minz, and
    Shuchita Grover; Gujarati by Noopur Datye and Supriya Tembe; Kannada by Divya Kowshik and Shuchita Grover; Telugu by
    Maithili Shingre and Omkar Shende; Malayalam by Maithili Shingre and Unnati Kotecha; and Tamil by Aadarsh Rajan.
    Baloo Devanagari and Latin are collaboratively designed by Ek Type. Font engineering and type design assistance by
    Girish Dalvi.
