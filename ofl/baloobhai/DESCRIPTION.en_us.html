A perfect blend of pointy paws in a coat of fur, Baloo is an affable display typeface by Ek Type. 
Available in nine Indian scripts along with a Latin counterpart, the family is unicode compliant and libre licensed.
</p>
<p>
Baloo is a distinctive heavy spurless design with a subtle tinge of playfulness and all the bare necessities of type. 
Snuggling several scripts under a single weight, the typeface focuses on giving equal justice to every act of this gentle jungle affair, to secure single and multi-script use. 
Carefree yet confident, warm yet entertaining, sprightly yet intelligible, Baloo infuses life everywhere it goes.
</p>
<p>
The Baloo family contains separate fonts with unique local names for each of the nine Indic Scripts. 
Each supports their script, plus Latin, Latin Extended, and Vietnamese.
