A perfect blend of pointy paws in a coat of fur, Baloo is an affable display typeface by Ek Type. 
Available in nine Indian scripts along with a Latin counterpart, the family is Unicode compliant and libre licensed.

Baloo 2 is an extension of the earlier Baloo project. The new Baloo 2 includes additional glyphs, engineering improvements, and has been extended to five weights, ranging from the light footed Regular to the affable ExtraBold. The lighter weights retain Baloo’s characteristic bounce, but they do so slightly, infusing life into each word. This allows the new family to freely fraternise with texts of all sizes and temperaments — be it short bursts or copious reams, demanding headlines or whispering bylines. Carefree yet confident, sprightly yet versatile, the renewed family of Baloo promises to bring warmth to every project.

<p>
The Baloo 2 project develops nine separate fonts with unique local names for each of the nine Indic Scripts. 
Each font supports one Indic subset plus Latin, Latin Extended, and Vietnamese.
