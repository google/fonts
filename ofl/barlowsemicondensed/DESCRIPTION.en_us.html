Barlow is a slightly rounded, low-contrast, grotesk type family.
Drawing from the visual style of the California public, Barlow shares qualities with the state's car plates, highway signs, busses, and trains.

<p>
This is the Semi Condensed family, which is part of the superfamily along with
<a href="http://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Condensed">Condensed</a>, and

each with 9 weights in Roman and Italic.

The Barlow project is led by Jeremy Tribby, a designer based in San Francisco, USA.
