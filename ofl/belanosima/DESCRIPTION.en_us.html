 Belanosima is a DocRepair font, intended to improve compliance with the ISO/IEC 29500 standard by providing fallback for Berlin Sans FB that minimizes text reflow in Office Open XML documents.
 Belanosima is based on Josefin Sans, a geometric, elegant family with a vintage feeling, for use at larger sizes.
 Josefin Sans is inspired by geometric sans serif designs from the 1920s.
