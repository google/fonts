<p>Bellota is an ornamented, low contrast sans-serif with text and swash alternates. Itâ€™s just cute enough!</p>

<p>It comes in two variations: Normal and Text. Each of these comes in three weights (Light/Regular/Bold) and Italics. There are stylistic alternates (for swash and non-ornamented characters) and ligatures available through OpenType features. Stylistic Set 1: Text, Stylistic Set 2: Swash caps.</p>
