Besley is a antique slab serif inspired by Robert Besley's Clarendon.
It features a full range of weights and matching italics, making it subtle for a variety of uses. A slight rounding of the corners gives a subtle warmth, and OpenType features such as ligatures and contextual substitutions perfect the finer details. It was made with love and will continue to improve with your support. </p>
