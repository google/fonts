We want to create a corporate typeface that is a perfect mixture between technology and humanism, the design must embrace our brand’s spirit, the youthful and modern voice of a tech company. More than that, we aim to design the first functional typeface that is completely made by Vietnamese designers and works seamlessly in any digital or non-digital environment.

The letterforms are clean, modern and straightforward, with a classic touch of humanist grotesque that make the typeface stands between the past and the future. Being made by native Vietnamese designers, it is sure that this typeface is so well-tailored for a smooth reading experience in Vietnamese with carefully-designed diacritics. What makes this typeface so unique, is that it’s functional: The built-in OpenType features help us achieve more, you can now type in symbols or icons with just a simple syntax (see instructions for icons in the Specimen). 
The complete family of "be Vietnam" comes with 7 weights and their matching slanted versions. Moreover, there will be a master type family of "be Vietnam" coming soon.
Through this new typeface, we want to seek for innovations and creativity - the fuel that drives humanity towards.

be Vietnam started from the internal design team at beGroup Vietnam with Gabriel Lam as the principal designer, Tony Le as the project manager and Vietanh Nguyen from uxlagi.com as the design engineer.
