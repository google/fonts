<p>Big Shoulders is a family of condensed American Gothic typefaces, created for the City of Chicago&apos;s Brand Standards. The family&apos;s tall, sans-serif forms are based in Chicago&apos;s multiple histories in railway transport, journalism, advertising, and public political action.</p>

<p>This is the Display family. A <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Big+Shoulders+Text">Text</a> family is also available.</p>
