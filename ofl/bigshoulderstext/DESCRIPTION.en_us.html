<p>Big Shoulders is a superfamily of condensed American Gothic variable fonts, created for the Chicago Design System, and the citizens of Chicago. The family&apos;s tall, sans-serif forms are based in Chicago&apos;s multiple histories in railway transport, public political action, and dance.</p>

<p><b>Big Shoulders</b> is used in the Chicago Design System as the primary typeface to identify Chicago and its citizens allowing the Chicagoans to speak with one consistent typographic voice.</p>

<p><b>Big Shoulders Stencil</b> explores Chicago&apos;s histories in work and protest, and is designed to apply the Chicagoan voice to those uses.</p>

<p><b>Big Shoulders Inline</b> formalizes a local typographic vernacular for celebration, taking its hypnotic inline design from Chicago House parties, and local LGBTQ dance events, a tradition beginning in the early 1980s.</p>
