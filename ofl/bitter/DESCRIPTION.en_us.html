<p> People read and interact with text on screens more and more each day. 
What happens on screen ends up being more important than what comes out of the printer. </p> 
<p>Bitter is a contemporary slab serif typeface specially designed for comfortable on-screen reading. 
It combines the large x-heights and legibility of the humanistic tradition with subtle characteristics in the characters that 
inject a certain rhythm to flowing texts.</p> 
<p>The typeface is balanced and manually spaced. 
It is legible, with a visual character that works well for fashion and blog writing, portfolio content, apps, 
or any use-case that involves marketing.
