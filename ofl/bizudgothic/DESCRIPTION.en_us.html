    TypeBank UD Gothic is a UD Gothic typeface with excellent readability and design balance. In order to make the Kanji characters more identifiable, the letters are simplified by omitting the unnecessary Hane (flick strokes) and Geta (vertical strokes extending through horizontal strokes at the bottom of Kanji). The face is widened by adjusting counters and other spaces, and paying close attention to the balance of each character's shape. The Kana characters are made slightly smaller than the Kanji characters to give the right amount of rhythm when forming long sentences in fine weights.
