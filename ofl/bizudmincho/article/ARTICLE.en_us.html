<p>As part of our larger effort to make great type accessible in more languages, Google Fonts is pleased to announce that the Japanese type foundry <a href="https://en.morisawa.co.jp/">Morisawa</a> has made 2 <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=morisawa&subset=japanese">BIZ Universal Design (UD) font families</a> available on Google Fonts, under the <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/OFL">SIL Open Font License</a>. These Gothic and Mincho designs, available in regular and bold weights and proportional and full width styles, are now also available in <a href="https://workspace.google.com/features/">Google Workspace</a>.</p>
<p>“Having these fonts available in Japan allows Google Education to align with the most widely used fonts in education publishing in Japan,” said Stuart Miller, Head of Marketing for Google Education in Asia Pacific (APAC). “This makes it easier for partners to collaborate with Google Education. It also ensures a more consistent, inclusive, delightful experience for the millions of teachers and students that use Google tools.”</p>
<p>Drawing on extensive end-user evaluation, the BIZ UD typefaces were developed using the <a href="https://universaldesign.ie/what-is-universal-design/the-7-principles/the-7-principles.html">principles of universal design</a> (UD) to ensure <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/legibility_readability">legibility</a> (the ease of differentiating individual characters) and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/legibility_readability">readability</a> (the ease of reading text overall). BIZ UD fonts are especially suited for conveying text accurately—for example, in educational settings, corporate communication environments, and other places that use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology">ICT</a>.</p>
