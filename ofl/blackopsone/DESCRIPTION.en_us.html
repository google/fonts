<p>Black Ops One is a low contrast, semi geometric typeface inspired by military stencil lettering. 
It is heavy, sturdy, punchy, and looks best when used at medium to large sizes because of the small cuts found in stencils.</p>
<p>In the July 2022 update, Black Ops One has improved language support.</p>
