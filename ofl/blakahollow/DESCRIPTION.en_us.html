    <em>Blaka</em> is an experimental typeface, enriching the gothic feeling of Black Letters by enhancing the
    geometric features to create midgrounds with the Kufic style for the Arabic letterforms.

<p>
    The aesthetical matching process between the two scripts relies on the features of being hand-drawn with a reed
    pen. While Latin letterforms maintain sharp edges, Arabic relies on sharp edges and thick strokes to create overlaps
    to replace a usual baseline in most letterforms, giving the Arabic letterforms contemporary features.

    The font family comes in two styles, Blaka and Blaka Hollow, featuring an outlined version of the font. Blaka also
    comes in two variants, the usual monochrome variants as well as an Ink variant <em>Blaka Ink</em>. The Ink variant
    are color fonts where the colors are defined by the font itself. Support for color fonts is currently limited to few
    applications like Google Chrome (version 98 or later).
