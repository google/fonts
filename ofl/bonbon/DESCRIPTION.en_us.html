Bonbon is a fancy handwriting font for cheerful and bright headlines. 
The letterforms are artistic and naive in nature as if it belongs in a teenage girl's diary. 
It is drawn with a fine marker by author Ksenia Erulevich. 
Curves are carefully adjusted so that the font will also work well in print - making it a good choice for appetizing product design, 
greeting cards, or titling in children's books. Extra ornamental characters are included.
