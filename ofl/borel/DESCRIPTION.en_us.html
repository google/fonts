    What considerations should be taken into account when approaching typography in the context of simultaneous learning of reading and writing? Borel is a French cursive primer — developed with primary school teachers and speech therapists — which aims aims to harmonise cursive strokes and common typographic structure. This typeface, named in tribute to Suzanne Borel-Maisonny (a pioneer in speech therapy), boasts a sturdy design featuring low contrast and a generous x-height. The letters are intentionally open and clearly differentiated while adhering to the conventions of handwriting in French schools.
