    This project provides Bopomofo (Zhuyin) enabled variants of Traditional Chinese typefaces, implementing the Bopomofo IVS Font Specification (bpmfvs) developed by ButTaiwan.
</p>
<p>
    Unlike traditional Bopomofo fonts that require separate font files for different pronunciations, these fonts utilize Ideographic Variation Sequences (IVS) and GSUB features to support polyphonic characters (multiple pronunciations) within a single font file. This allows users to switch between pronunciations seamlessly while maintaining the same typeface.
