    This project provides Bopomofo (Zhuyin) enabled variants of Traditional Chinese typefaces, implementing the Bopomofo IVS Font Specification (bpmfvs) developed by ButTaiwan and particularly intended for use with <a href="https://buttaiwan.github.io/bpmfvs/">buttaiwan.github.io/bpmfvs/</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Unlike traditional Bopomofo fonts that require separate font files for different pronunciations, these fonts utilize Ideographic Variation Sequences (IVS) and GSUB features to support polyphonic characters within a single font file. This allows users to seamlessly add pronunciation guides while maintaining the same typeface.
