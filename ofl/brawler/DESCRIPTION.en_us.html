<p>Brawler is a compact typeface with sharp features and a sturdy character, designed for comfortable reading in small
    sizes. It was initially planned as a typeface for newspapers and tabloids. Thus, the design concept was shaped by
    the demands of low quality printing media and the aesthetic preferences of periodical publications.</p>
