<p>Based on <a href="https://studiotriple.fr/travaux/typefaces/mayenne" >Mayenne </a>, Bricolage Grotesque is a collage of lots of different things: historical sources, technical decisions and personal feelings. It started as a fork of Mayenne Sans, an open-source single weight font designed by Jérémy Landes. It evolved by reinforcing cues from French sources and British sources: the compressed weights lean more towards the anxious and wonky tones of Grotesque Nº9 and the regular weights have a bit more of Antique Olive's relaxed and confident attitude. The smaller optical sizes become more neutral and reflective of contemporary sans serifs, notably through the use of exaggerated ink traps.</p>

<p>By blending iconic British and French designs with modern trends and tools, it aims to traverse a complex typographical and emotional landscape. At the same time, it’s so steeped in historical sources and references that it’s hard to call it anything but a re-interpretation of the same ideas but for a different purpose: trying to express visually what it feels like to move countries and rebuild, what it feels like to have a hybrid identity where you cannot be what you were and yet you can never truly be anybody else.</p>
