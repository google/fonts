 Briem Hand is elegant while also being quite accessible and very legible.
 It is direct and sincere without being excessively sentimental.
 It provides a range of weights, and comes with and without guides and joins.
 Briem Hand is an extended version of Gunnlaugur's 'Briem Script' which was designed in 1992.
 The Briem Hand is a modern adaptation of sixteenth-century chancery cursive.
