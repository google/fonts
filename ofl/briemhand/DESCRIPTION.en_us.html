Briem Hand is elegant while also being quite accessible and very legible. It is direct and sincere without being excessively sentimental. It provides a range of weights, and comes with and without guides and joins. Briem Hand is an extended version of Gunnlaugur's 'Briem Script' which was designed in 1992. The Briem Hand is a modern adaptation of sixteenth-century chancery cursive.
