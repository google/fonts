<p>Brygada 1918 is a revival project created for the celebration of the 100 years of independance of the Republic of Poland in 2018, with the support of the "Independent" program and the President of the Republic of Poland. The typeface is based on the catalogue entry of the National Type Foundry from 1954, and a set of matrices found at the Book Arts Museum by Janusz Tryzno in 2016. More info about the project available on the <a href="https://brygada1918.eu/?lang=en">projects website</a>.
