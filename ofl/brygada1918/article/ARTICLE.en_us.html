<p>A man uncovers an unused font in dusty piles of metal plates and blocks. He is intrigued by the mysterious letters “K” and “R” with curly legs, and a handwritten note on old brown paper that says “Brygada.” He starts an archeological quest to research the origins of the font–and inspires a team to revive the font with 21st century software and a microscopic camera.</p>
<p>Is this the plot line for a new “Indiana Jones” movie or the origin story for a remade digitized font?</p>
<p>It’s the latter. It’s the story of Brygada, a lost and forgotten 20th century typeface remade for the 21st century.</p>

<p>It was the summer of 2015 and Mr. Janusz Tryzno was the owner of the Book Art Museum of Łódź located in a 19th century villa in Łódź (pronounced “Woodge”), Poland. He dug through piles of font matrices (metal blocks with letter shapes used to cast letters) and metal plates wrapped in brown paper from the Polish National Type Foundry. After uncovering the Brygada matrices, he asked museum volunteers, Przemysław Hoffer and Borys Kosmynka, to examine the matrices to see if they could bring the font back to life.</p>
