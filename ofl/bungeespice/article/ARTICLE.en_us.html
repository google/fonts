	In the crowded urban environment, space for signage is always at a premium.
	From crummy liquor stores to majestic theaters, sometimes signs have nowhere to
	go but up.
</p>
<p>
	Bungee is a font that celebrates urban signs that stack the Latin alphabet, one
	letter on top of the other, in order to make dramatic use of limited space.
	Following their lead, Bungee typesets horizontally <em>and</em> vertically, so
	it is always ready to take your text in a new direction.
</p>
<p>
	Bungee’s letterforms were designed to reinforce a sense of verticality. Round
	characters like <strong>O</strong> and diagonal characters like
	<strong>A</strong> are straight-sided, and letters like <strong>L</strong> and
	<strong>I</strong> gain serifs in order to create vertical words with
	well-defined left and right edges.
</p>

<p>
    This font uses the COLRv1, CPAL and SVG tables. Please visit

<h4>Bungee’s color fonts</h4>
<p>
	Bungee was an early
	<a href="https://www.economist.com/babbage/2013/08/22/over-the-rainbow"
		>experimental color font</a>, and has been updated as color font technology
		has developed over the past	decade. Both Bungee Tint (flat colors) and
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee+Spice">Bungee Spice</a>
	(gradients) contain multiple color palettes, so it is possible to create
	chromatic effects even in the most basic typesetting environments. Hopefully
	these fonts will help designers and developers explore the possibilities of
	what color fonts have to offer.

	The Bungee project is led by David Jonathan Ross, and thanks to support from
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com">Google</a> and
	<a href="https://fontbureau.com">The Font Bureau</a>, Bungee was released under
	the SIL <a href="http://openfontlicense.org">Open Font License</a>.
</p>

<p>
	In 2023–24, Marte Verhaegen and Just van Rossum produced a major revision (v2),
	which includes an automated build process as well as many enhancements to the
	vertical features and color fonts.
