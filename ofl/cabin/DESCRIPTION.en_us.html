<p>Cabin is a humanist sans inspired by Edward Johnston&apos;s and Eric Gill&apos;s typefaces with a touch of modernism.
     Cabin incorporates modern proportions, optical adjustments, and some elements of the geometric sans. It remains true to its roots, but has its own personality.</p>
     
<p>The Cabin font family comes in two variable fonts that includes a Condensed version, four weights plus true italics. The weight distribution is almost monotone, although top and bottom curves are slightly thin. Counters of the b, g, p and q are rounded and optically adjusted.</p>

<p>Cabin language support includes full coverage of Vietnamese, additional to all Western, Central, and South-Eastern European languages.</p>
