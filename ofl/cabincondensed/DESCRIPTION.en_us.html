<p>This is the condensed set of styles in the Cabin font family; a humanist sans with 4 weights plus true italics, inspired by Edward Johnston’s and Eric Gill’s typefaces, with a touch of modernism.</p> <p>Cabin incorporates modern proportions, optical adjustments, and some elements of the geometric sans.</p> <p>It remains true to its roots, but has its own personality.</p> <p>The weight distribution is almost monotone, although top and bottom curves are slightly thin.</p> <p>Counters of the b, g, p and q are rounded and optically adjusted. The curved stem endings have a 10 degree angle. E and F have shorter center arms. M is splashed.</p>
