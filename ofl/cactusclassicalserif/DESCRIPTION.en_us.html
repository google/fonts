<p>"Cactus Classical Serif" is an open source font suitable for Traditional Chinese environments. This font uses inherited glyphs, largely adhering to the <i>Inherited Glyphs standard</i> maintained by the <i>I.Font Project</i>, combined with other commonly seen inherited glyphs, to produce a Chinese typeface with glyphs in the traditional style.</p>

<p>This font is produced by Tian Haidong. Moonlit Owen has assisted in the font production and is also a maintainer.</p>

<p>The CJK characters are based on glyphs prepared by Henry Chan on GlyphWiki, with modifications and characters supplemented by Tian Haidong.</p>

<p>The Latin characters, Kana characters, and other symbols are based on glyphs from the <i>Genyo Font</i> developed by But Ko based on <i>Source Han Serif</i>.</p>
