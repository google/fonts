<p>The Cantarell typeface family was designed during Dave Crossland's study of MA Typeface Design in 2009 in the Department of Typography at the University of Reading (UK).</p> 

<p>The typeface is designed as a contemporary Humanist sans serif, and was developed for on-screen reading; in particular, reading web pages on an HTC Dream mobile phone.</p>  

<p>This family was developed using only open-source softwares, mainly FontForge. Typeface designs are tools too, and therefore these font files are licensed in a way that respects your freedom â€” you are invited to extend them to meet your needs, such as to add the glyphs missing from your own writing systems, under the terms of the Open Font License.</p>

<p> In October 2022 some metadata were fixed such as license clification, style name and style linking. Users may notice that the style "Oblique" has changed to "Italic".</p>
