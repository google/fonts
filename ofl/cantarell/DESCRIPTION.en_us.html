The Cantarell typeface family was designed as a graduation project for the MA Typeface Design programme 
in the Department of Typography at the University of Reading (UK.) 
A contemporary humanist sans serif, it was developed for on-screen reading; in particular, reading web pages on cheap Android devices.
