 Caprasimo is a DocRepair font, intended to improve compliance with the ISO/IEC 29500 standard by providing fallback for Cooper Black that minimizes text reflow in Office Open XML documents.
 Caprasimo is based on Fraunces, a display, old-style soft-serif typeface inspired by the mannerisms of early 20th century typefaces such as the Cooper Series.
 Fraunces was designed by Phaedra Charles and Flavia Zimbardi, partners at Undercase Type.
