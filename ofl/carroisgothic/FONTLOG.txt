Basic Font Information

Carrois Gothic was designed by Ralph du Carrois.

Carrois Gothic is a well balanced and modern gothic type family. Clean and
beautiful. What more do you need? There is the Small Caps sister family too,
useful for all noble and significant applications.

Carrois Gothic is a Unicode typeface that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and 
could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1

For each style there are three .VFB Source files:
1. Family-Style.vfb (Original Source file with contour overlaps)
2. Family-Style-OTF.vfb (Merged contours and optimized file 
                         corresponding to the OTF file)
3. Family-Style-TTF.vfb (TrueType outlines with hinting 
                         adjustments corresponding to the TTF file)
