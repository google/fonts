Satsuyako first released the kana font CherryBomb in 2012 with the concept, "Cute with a kick." Its round and modern bounciness has made it appealing for diverse use from title logos and food packaging to children' s magazines.

To publish on Google Fonts, the designer adjusted the outline and balance of all the letters, added symbols and Latin glyphs, and made it into a proportional font that could also be used in the vertical writing style.
