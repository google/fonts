<p>Chiron Hei HK (昭源黑體) is a Traditional Chinese sans typeface based on Adobe's Source Han Sans (a.k.a. Google's Noto Sans CJK). The font aims at providing a modern, region-agnostic glyph set adopting the "modern" glyph style that is similar to the prevailing, usually commercial, typefaces in the Traditional Chinese regions.</p>

<p>In Chiron Hei HK, glyph shapes in Source Han Sans Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong) are reviewed and adjusted for the better display effect on screen and in print. The font takes references from the glyph shapes of typefaces commonly seen in daily life to provide a set of regional agnostic, modern-style glyphs that balance standard glyph shapes and the usual stroke forms of printed typefaces. The glyph set is similar to the prevailing, usually commercial, typefaces in the Traditional Chinese communities.</p>
