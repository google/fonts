<p>Chivo ("Goat" in Spanish) is Omnibus-Type's first grotesque family. The strength of Chivo Black makes it ideal for highlights and headlines whilst Chivo Regular's elegance is ideal for continuous reading. Its design details make it an indispensable ally for any designer.</p>

<p>In october 2022, the family is upgraded to a variable font ranging from Thin to Black, including matching italics. The glyphset has also been extended, supporting now a wider number of languages.</p>

<p>The family was developed by HÃ©ctor Gatti. To contribute, see <a href="https://github.com/Omnibus-Type/Chivo">github.com/Omnibus-Type/Chivo</a>.</p>
