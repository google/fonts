Coiny is a typeface designed originally for the Latin and Tamil scripts in parallel. 
Naturally bold, and born on street to shine on screen.
It has a structure based on simple geometrical shapes, and is inspired by the vernacular designs seen around every big city. 
The forms are similar to those found with writing made with a rounded brush point. 
It is a lot of fun for titles and headlines.

The Coiny project is led by Marcelo Magalhães, a type designer based in São Paulo, Brasil.
