Comic Neue is an original reinterpretation of the classic, Comic Sans.
</p>
<p>
Comic Neue aspires to be the casual script choice for everyone, including the typographically savvy.
The squashed, wonky, and weird glyphs of Comic Sans have been beaten into shape â€“ while maintaining the honesty that made Comic Sans so popular.
