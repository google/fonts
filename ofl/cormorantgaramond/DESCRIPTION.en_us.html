<p>Cormorant Garamond is a member of the Cormorant family - a free display type family developed by Christian Thalmann. 
The project currently comprises a total of 45 font files spanning 9 different visual styles 
(Roman, Italic, Infant, Infant Italic, Garamond, Garamond Italic, Upright Cursive, Small Caps, and Unicase) 
and 5 weights (Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold.)

While this project was heavily inspired by Claude Garamont's immortal legacy, Christian did not use any specific font as a starting point 
or direct reference for the designs. Most glyphs were drawn from scratch; when he needed guidance on a specific character, 
he searched for the term Garamond and skimmed through the results for a general impression.
