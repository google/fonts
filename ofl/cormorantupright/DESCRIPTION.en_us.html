While this project was heavily inspired by Claude Garamont's immortal legacy, Christian did not use any specific font as a starting point 
or direct reference for the designs. Most glyphs were drawn from scratch; when he needed guidance on a specific character, 
he searched for the term Garamond and skimmed through the results for a general impression.

The Cormorant project is led by Christian Thalmann, a type designer based in Zurich, Switzerland.
