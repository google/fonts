    The Cossette font family is a classic in the making, building on a legacy of everyday graphics.
    Based on the foundations of the Cossette brand, it combines typical grotesque design with a
    subtle inverted contrast to create a distinct visual voice that feels both familiar and unexpected.

    The fonts are currently available in two versions—Cossette Titre and Cossette Texte—designed
    to pair beautifully together. Cossette Titre is more condensed to maximize impact in any given
    space, while Cossette Texte is wider set to maximize sentence legibility.
