    The Cossette font family is a classic in the making, building on a legacy of everyday graphics.
    Based on the foundations of the Cossette brand, it combines typical grotesque design with a
    subtle inverted contrast to create a distinct visual voice that feels both familiar and unexpected.

    The fonts are currently available in two versions —
	this Cossette Titre and 
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cossette+Titre">Cossette Texte</a>—designed
    to pair beautifully together. Cossette Titre is more condensed to maximize impact in any given
    space, while Cossette Texte is wider set to maximize sentence legibility.
