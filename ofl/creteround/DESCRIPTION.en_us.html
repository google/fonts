Crete Round is a warm slab serif providing a hint of softness to texts.
It started as a tailored version of the <a href="http://www.type-together.com/Crete">original Crete fonts</a>, created specially to serve as corporate typeface for the type design competition <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110826033437/http://letter2.org">Letter2</a>.
Crete Round is more independent from the original with modified terminals and serifs to create two new fonts that deliver a more contemporary and functional appearance.
The tall x-height, low contrast and sturdy slabs prove to be surprisingly efficient for web use.
