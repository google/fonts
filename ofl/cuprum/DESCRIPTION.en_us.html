Cuprum was created in 2006 based on the work of Miles Newlyn. Cuprum is a narrow grotesque typeface that is quite versatile. 
An interesting history of the appearance of its name: Cuprum is copper, not gold or silver. 
Copper is noble, but it is much cheaper and not used for medals but for everyday items like pots, hence, 
lending the type its versatile feature.
