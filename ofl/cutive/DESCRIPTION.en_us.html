<p>The design of Cutive, and this monospace sister family
<a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Cutive+Mono">Cutive Mono</a>, is
based on a number of classic typewriter typefaces, in particular the faces of
IBM's 'Executive,' and the older 'Smith-Premier.' In Cutive these old faces
re-emerge as webfonts that are useful for adding character to body texts as
well as in larger sizes for headers and display.</p>
