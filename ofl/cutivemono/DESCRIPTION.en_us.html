<p>
 The design of
 <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Cutive">
  Cutive
 </a>
 , and this monospace sister family Cutive Mono, is based on a number of classic typewriter typefaces, in particular the faces of IBM's 'Executive,' and the older 'Smith-Premier.' In Cutive these old faces re-emerge as webfonts that are useful for adding character to body texts as well as in larger sizes for headers and display.
