<p>The design of 
<a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Cutive">Cutive</a>, and this
monospace sister family Cutive Mono, is based on a number of classic
typewriter typefaces, in particular the faces of IBM's 'Executive,' and the
older 'Smith-Premier.' In Cutive these old faces re-emerge as webfonts that
are useful for adding character to body texts as well as in larger sizes for
headers and display.</p>
