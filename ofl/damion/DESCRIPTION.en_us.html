<p>
 Damion is a casual script face derived from some typical mid C20 casual typefaces such as that drawn by Max Kaufmann in 1936 for American Type Founders.
</p>
<p>
 Damion has taken these and similar type forms and also added some of it's own forms to create a casual webfont for Display use on modern web pages.

<p>Latest upgrade from April 2024 expands the Latin script language coverage.</p>
