<p>Danfo, a variable-axis font, is the result of a collaboration between Afrotype and Abu, a lettering artist from Ojota Bus Stop. It is inspired by the cut-out shapes of vinyl sticker lettering on public transportation buses in Lagos, Nigeria. This font, the first project from Afrotype, is an improved version of the 2018 design, now featuring a richer character set that supports all of Sub-Saharan African Latin. Danfo is the base set of a family of Danfo fonts Afrotype plans to release.</p>
