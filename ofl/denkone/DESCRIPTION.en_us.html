<p>Denk One is a medium contrast display sans serif. It was inspired by a hand
painted German sign. It has been carefully adjusted to the restrictions of the
screen. Despite having display characteristics, Denk One can be used in a wide
range of sizes.</p>

<p>Latest upgrade from February 2023 expands the Latin script language coverage.</p>
