<p>Diplomata started several years ago when a friend in the printing industry
who had an old metal typeface wanted it to be digitalized for offset printing.
He brought everything the original type offered as a start, a set of upper
case characters, numbers, and some punctuation marks.</p>

<p>But what he brought in printed form was not enough to meet his needs, and
letterforms that did not exist had to be created. It is a fine job to
reinterpret a design, to make decisions on what already exists and also have
in mind the changes needed for the new technological context where Diplomata
will be used.</p>

<p>Its style, similar to Bodoni, has a remarkable degree of horizontal
expansion; a weight which indicates verticality; areas between serif and stem
softened by a curve connecting them, and the light in the main stroke of each
glyph is a detail that lightens up and gives prominence to Diplomata. It is a
distinct typeface, ideal for composing headlines and small prestigious pieces
of text.</p>

<p>The February 2023 update features a bigger glyphset, fractions and some minor aesthetic modifications.</p>

<p>To improve and expand the use of Diplomata, it was necessary to create
small caps and <a

which ended up constituting this family that has two variables today.</p>
