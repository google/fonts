DM Mono is a three weight, three style family designed for DeepMind. DM Mono was loosely based off of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans">DM Sans</a>, with a reduction in contrast and less geometric proportions.
</p>
<p>
The type design and font development was commissioned from <a href="https://www.colophon-foundry.org/">Colophon Foundry</a>, with Creative Direction from the DeepMind team.
