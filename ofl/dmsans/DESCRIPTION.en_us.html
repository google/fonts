<p>DM Sans is a low-contrast geometric sans serif design, intended for use at smaller text sizes.</p>

<p>DM Sans supports a Latin Extended glyph set, enabling typesetting for English and other Western European languages.
It was designed by Colophon Foundry (UK), that started from the Latin portion of ITF <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins">Poppins</a>, by Jonny Pinhorn.</p>

<p>In May 2023 DM Sans is updated, expanding the coverage of the weight range to Thin & ExtraBlack (100–1000 weight range) along with a new optical size axis.</p>
