DM Sans is a low-contrast geometric sans serif design, intended for use at smaller text sizes.
</p>
<p>
DM Sans supports a Latin Extended glyph set, enabling typesetting for English and other Western European languages.
It was designed by Colophon Foundry (UK), who started from the Latin portion of Indian Type Foundry's <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins">Poppins</a>.

In May 2023 DM Sans is updated, expanding the coverage of the weight range to Thin & ExtraBlack (100â€“1000 weight range) along with a new optical size axis.
