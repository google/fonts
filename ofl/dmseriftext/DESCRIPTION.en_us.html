DM Serif Text is a lower-contrast counterpart to the high-contrast <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Serif+Display">DM Serif Display</a>.
While the serifs remain delicate, the DM Serif Text family is a more robust variant of the Display sibling, intended for smaller sub-headings and text sizes.

DM Serif Text supports a Latin Extended glyph set, enabling typesetting for English and other Western European languages.
It was designed by Colophon Foundry (UK), that started from the Latin portion of Adobe <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+Pro">Source Serif Pro</a>, by Frank Grie√ühammer.
