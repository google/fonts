Dorsa is a modern interpretation of Empire (a condensed typeface designed by Morris Benton Fuller for ATF in 1937) 
with some personal details.

It is a little less condensed than the original Empire because Santiago Orozco wanted it to be used in titles, 
and combined with positive letter spacing to give an elegant look to the text. 
Although the original hasn't got a lowercase, he studied a lot of skyline typefaces and drew a fully original lowercase.

The lowercase “o”, which isn't completely geometric, is expanded to the outside, keeping the same whitespace through all weights. 
And this repeats all over the typeface, because the construction of all the characters was modular, based on that “o”; 
the “f” is designed to not meet any of the diacritics; and uppercase “A” has a traditional form which enhances legibility.
