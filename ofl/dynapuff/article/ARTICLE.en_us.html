<h4>Create custom text stickers on Android and Pixel phones</h4>
<p>There’s a new way to make stickers in Android and Pixel phones, with the DynaPuff typeface.</p>
<p>Tired of writing “Good night” and “Happy birthday” in boring text-only messages? Perhaps you have fond memories of getting stickers when you were a kid and would like to send stickers as greetings to your friends... But it just takes too long to search for stickers on the keyboard when writing messages.</p>
<p>You can make custom text stickers with the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DynaPuff">DynaPuff</a> typeface on Google’s keyboard, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin">Gboard</a>, running on Android and Pixel devices. Most recently, this project was recognized as a finalist in <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90770987/apps-and-games-innovation-by-design-2022">Fast Company’s Innovation Design Awards</a>.</p>
