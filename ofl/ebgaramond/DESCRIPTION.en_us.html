EB Garamond is intended to be an excellent, classical, Garamond. 
It is a community project to create a revival of Claude Garamont’s famous humanist typefaces from the mid-16th century. 
This digital version reproduces the original design by Claude Garamont closely: 
The source for the letterforms is a scan of a specimen known as the “Berner specimen,” which was composed in 1592 by Conrad Berner, 
the son-in-law of Christian Egenolff and his successor at the Egenolff print office. 
This specimen shows Garamont’s roman and Granjon’s italic types at different sizes. 
Hence the name of this project: Egenolff-Berner Garamond.
