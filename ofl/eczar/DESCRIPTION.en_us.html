    Eczar started as a student project in 2010–11 during Vaibhav Singh’s MA studies in Typeface Design at the University
    of
    Reading. Eczar was designed to bring liveliness and vigor to multi-script typesetting in Latin and Devanagari – with
    the intention of providing an alternative to existing designs by imparting a strong mix of personality and
    performance, both at text sizes and in display settings. The family offers a wide expressive range and the display
    qualities of the design intensify with corresponding increase in weight, making the heaviest weights best suited for
    headlines and display purposes.
