Eczar is designed by Vaibhav Singh, produced by David Březina, and published by Rosetta Type Foundry.
It began as a student project in 2010 during Vaibhav’s MA Typeface Design studies at the University of Reading (UK).
Eczar was designed to bring liveliness and vigor to multi-script typesetting in Latin and Devanagari, and providing an alternative to existing designs by imparting a strong mix of personality and performance at both text and display sizes.
The display qualities of the design intensify in the heavier weights, and the heaviest is best suited for headline and display purposes.
