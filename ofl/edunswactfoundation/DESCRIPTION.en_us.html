<p>The <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=Edu">Educational School Fonts collection</a> is a set of handwriting fonts for teachers and pupils.</p>
    
<p>Each Australian state teaches different handwriting styles in lower primary school (although some states do share the same style), in line with Department of Education Australia standards. There are essentially three stages involved with each state's styles:
    <ol>
        <li>The foundational stage involves learning basic letter formation.</li>
        <li>The transitional stage adds joining ligatures to some letters.</li>
        <li>The cursive stage joins almost all letters (with some exceptions).</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
The <em>NSW ACT School Fonts</em> include both:
    <ul>
        <li>New South Wales Foundation Print - a simple sloped print for early primary school.</li>
        <li>New South Wales Foundation Cursive - transitional joining letter alternates (pre-cursive stage).</li>
    </ul>

Students in New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory learn Foundation Print from years 1 to 2 and Beginner Cursive from year 3.
