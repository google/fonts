<p>The <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=Edu">Foundation Fonts for Australian Schools collection</a> is a set of handwriting fonts designed specifically to meet Australian Education standards. While weights, widths and optical sizes were carefully crafted to work well in an Australian classroom environment, they are just as comfortable to read and work with in the home environment.</p>
    
<p>Each Australian state teaches different handwriting styles in lower primary school (although some states do share the same style). There are essentially three stages involved with each state's styles:
    <ol>
        <li>The foundational stage involves learning basic letter formation.</li>
        <li>The transitional stage adds joining ligatures to some letters.</li>
        <li>The cursive stage joins almost all letters (with some exceptions).</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
The <em>QLD School Fonts</em> include both:
    <ul>
        <li>Queensland Beginners Alphabet - a simple sloped print for early primary school.</li>
        <li>Queensland Beginners Cursive - transitional joining letter alternates (pre-cursive stage).</li>
    </ul>
    
Students in Queensland learn QBeginners from years 1 to 3 and QCursive from year 4.
