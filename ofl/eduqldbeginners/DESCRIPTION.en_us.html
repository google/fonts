<p>The <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=Edu">Educational School Fonts collection</a> is a set of handwriting fonts for teachers and pupils.</p>
    
<p>Each Australian state teaches different handwriting styles in lower primary school (although some states do share the same style), in line with Department of Education Australia standards. There are essentially three stages involved with each state's styles:
    <ol>
        <li>The foundational stage involves learning basic letter formation.</li>
        <li>The transitional stage adds joining ligatures to some letters.</li>
        <li>The cursive stage joins almost all letters (with some exceptions).</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
The <em>QLD School Fonts</em> includes both:
    <ul>
        <li>Queensland Beginners Alphabet - a simple sloped print for early primary school.</li>
        <li>Queensland Beginners Cursive - transitional joining letter alternates (pre-cursive stage).</li>
    </ul>
    
Students in Queensland learn QBeginners from years 1 to 3 and QCursive from year 4.
