<p>The <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=Edu">Foundation Fonts for Australian Schools collection</a> is a set of handwriting fonts designed specifically to meet Australian Education standards. While weights, widths and optical sizes were carefully crafted to work well in an Australian classroom environment, they are just as comfortable to read and work with in the home environment.</p>
<p>Each Australian state teaches different handwriting styles in lower primary school (although some states do share the same style). There are essentially three stages involved with each state's styles:
  <ol>
    <li>The foundational stage involves learning basic letter formation.</li>
    <li>The transitional stage adds joining ligatures to some letters.</li>
    <li>The cursive stage joins almost all letters (with some exceptions).</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  The <em>TAS School Fonts</em> include:
  <ul>
    <li>Tasmania Beginners Alphabet - a simple sloped print for early primary school.</li>
  </ul>
  Students in Tasmania learn the Beginners Alphabet from years 1 and 2, moving on to Pre-Cursive from year 3.

<h3>The handwriting fonts that help Australian students learn how to read and write are now available in Google Workspace</h3>

<p><a href="http://edu.google.com.au/">Google for Education Australia</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> partnered to make Foundation Fonts for Australian Schools available on <a href="https://workspace.google.com/">Google Workspace</a>, including Google Workspace for Education. The fonts are also available for download from the Google Fonts website.</p>
<p>Australian teachers are required to use state-mandated handwriting styles to teach reading and writing to school children from ages four to nine. Designed by Tina and Corey Anderson, the five Foundation Fonts exemplify proper handwriting for English and other languages using the Latin writing system, and include common math symbols. The regular weight of each font imitates the pencil thickness of handwriting, making the fonts easy for students to recognize as they learn how to write letter shapes.</p>
<p>The availability of these fonts on Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides is also important for the adoption of Chromebooks and Google Workspace for Education in Australian schools.</p>
