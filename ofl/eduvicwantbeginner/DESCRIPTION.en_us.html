<p>Each Australian state teaches different handwriting styles in lower primary school (although some states do share the same style), in line with Department of Education Australia standards. There are essentially three stages involved with each state's styles:
<ol>
    <li>The foundational stage involves learning basic letter formation</li>
    <li>The transitional stage adds joining ligatures to some letters</li>
    <li>The cursive stage joins almost all letters (with some exceptions)</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>The initial weight (300) of foundational font-sets included in this repo is intended to imitate the pencil thickness of actual handwriting, however they're also variable fonts so they may be adjusted up to Extra Bold weight (800), depending on usage requirements.<br>The foundational fonts contain alternate glyphs (or ligatures) for transitional stages to their full cursive counterparts, depending on usage requirements.
</p>

<p>The full cursive counterparts are a future project. The initial weight (200) of full cursive font-sets will imitate ball point pen thickness and are envisaged to be variable fonts also (up to 800) for consistency. This part of development will involve testing software provided by a third party, hence the variability and overall design scope may differ, although consistency between the font-sets will remain a primary focus.</p>
<p>VIC WA NT School Fonts</p>
<ul>This font-set includes:
    <li>Victoria, Western Australia and Northern Territory Label Print Alphabet - a simple sloped print for early primary school</li>
    <li>Students in Victoria, Western Australia and Northern Territory learn Label Print from years 1 to 3 and Infant Cursive from year 4.</li>
</ul>
