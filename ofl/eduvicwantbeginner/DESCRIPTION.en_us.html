<p>The <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=Edu">Foundation Fonts for Australian Schools collection</a> is a set of handwriting fonts designed specifically to meet Australian Education standards. While weights, widths and optical sizes were carefully crafted to work well in an Australian classroom environment, they are just as comfortable to read and work with in the home environment.</p>
    
<p>Each Australian state teaches different handwriting styles in lower primary school (although some states do share the same style). There are essentially three stages involved with each state's styles:
    <ol>
        <li>The foundational stage involves learning basic letter formation.</li>
        <li>The transitional stage adds joining ligatures to some letters.</li>
        <li>The cursive stage joins almost all letters (with some exceptions).</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
The <em>VIC WA NT School Fonts</em> include:
    <ul>
        <li>Victoria, Western Australia and Northern Territory Label Print Alphabet - a simple sloped print for early primary school.</li>
    </ul>

Students in Victoria, Western Australia and Northern Territory learn Label Print from years 1 to 3 and Infant Cursive from year 4.
