<p><a href="http://edu.google.com.au/">Google for Education Australia</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> partnered to make Foundation Fonts for Australian Schools available on <a href="https://workspace.google.com/">Google Workspace</a>, including Google Workspace for Education. The fonts are also available for download from the Google Fonts website.</p>
<p>Australian teachers are required to use state-mandated handwriting styles to teach reading and writing to school children from ages four to nine. Designed by Tina and Corey Anderson, the five Foundation Fonts exemplify proper handwriting for English and other languages using the Latin writing system, and include common math symbols. The regular weight of each font imitates the pencil thickness of handwriting, making the fonts easy for students to recognize as they learn how to write letter shapes.</p>
<p>The availability of these fonts on Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides is also important for the adoption of Chromebooks and Google Workspace for Education in Australian schools.</p>
