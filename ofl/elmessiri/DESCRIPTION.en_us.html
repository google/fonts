El Messiri is a modern Arabic typeface family designed by Mohamed Gaber (Arabic) that began with Jovanny Lemonad's Latin and Cyrillic typeface <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Philosopher">Philosopher</a>. 
The Arabic started with the concept of a curvy Arabic typeface inspired by the beauty of Naskh and drawn as if with a brush instead of the traditional bamboo pen. 
The idea took form with wide counters that improve readability at smaller text sizes, and has subtle details that make it a great display face at larger sizes. 
El Messiri current comes in 4 weights (Light, Regular, SemiBold and Bold) and the Arabic component has a wide glyph set that supports the Arabic, Farsi and Urdu languages.

The El Messiri project is led by Mohamed Gaber, a type designer based in Cairo, Egypt.
