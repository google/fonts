    Emery Cubic is a geometric display font designed for animation on the web. Created as part of a bachelor thesis, it
    was driven by the ambition to develop a striking, variable font that blends state-of-the-art technology with the art
    of typography.</p>
<p>
    Its precise, technical look is softened by rounded corners and detailed edges, giving it some warmth and
    characterâ€”reminiscent of the refinement achieved with emery paper.</p>
<p>
    The font features 12 masters, each with over 700 designed glyphs, and is built on three variable axes: weight,
    y-extension, and sharpness. These axes enable seamless transformations, making Emery Cubic ideal for animated and
    interactive use.</p>
<p>
    Overall, Emery Cubic is a versatile and distinctive typeface, offering designers and developers a powerful tool to
    create dynamic, eye-catching, and engaging content on the web.
