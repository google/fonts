    Encode Sans is a versatile workhorse sans-serif superfamily ready for
    all kinds of typographic challenges, offering a unique blend of warmth and
    practicality. Its humanist aspects of simple letterforms and open apertures keep it
    crisp and legible, while its geometric approach of rounded letters with 
    partially-straightened sides delivers a friendly but precise tone.

    It includes 5 widths from Condensed to Expanded, each with 9 weights from Light 
    to Black. To simplify the use of smallcaps in word processors, there are also 
    small-cap versions of each family.

    This project was initially designed by Pablo Impallari and Andres Torresi, refined 
    by Jacques Le Bailly, and upgraded as a variable font by Stephen Nixon and Marc Foley.
