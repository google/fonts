    Encode Sans is a versatile workhorse sans-serif design, featuring a huge range of weights and
    widths, ready for all kind of typographic challenges.

    This is a Smallcap version, made to allow use of the OpenType smallcap feature within word
    processors and to provide a smaller font file for contexts in which only smallcaps are desired.
    You can find other widths at
