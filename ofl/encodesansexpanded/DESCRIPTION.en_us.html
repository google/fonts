    Encode Sans is a versatile workhorse sans-serif superfamily ready for
    all kinds of typographic challenges, offering a unique blend of warmth and
    practicality. Its humanist aspects of simple letterforms and open apertures keep it
    crisp and legible, while its geometric approach of rounded letters with partially-straightened sides delivers a
    friendly but precise tone.

    It includes 5 widths from Condensed to Expanded, each with
    9 weights from Light to Black. To simplify the use of smallcaps in word processors, there are also
    small-cap versions of each family.
