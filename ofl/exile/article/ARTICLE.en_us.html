    The author saw it as a great challenge to design custom fonts for bands as a personal project. Their idea was to
    create a stencil typeface due to its practicality. It needed to be bold and loud, without compromising on
    design &emdash; making an all-caps approach essential. The contrast between swashy, soft, tongue-like elements and
    sharp, heavy slab serifs gave it the unique look the author envisioned. Its name was inspired by one of the authorâ€™s
    favorite Rolling Stones albums, <em>Exile on Main St</em>.
