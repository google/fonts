<p>Familjen Grotesk is a sans serif typeface with a contemporary appearance intended for both text and display. Large notches known as "ink traps" add style to headlines and clarity to small size text. The large x-height, closed apertures and sturdy upper-case letters relate to the grotesque subgenre of sans serifs.</p>
