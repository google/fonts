Fanwood Text is a revival of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfield_%28typeface%29">Fairfield</a>, the typeface first published in 1940 and designed by Rudolph Ruzicka, a famous Czech-American type designer. 
The roman and italic are slightly darker and reduced in contrast than the original; this was tailored for increased readability on the Amazon Kindle 3 e-book reader hardware.
