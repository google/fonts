    The Khmer fonts are designed for readable and beautiful rendering of text in the Khmer script, the national language
    of Cambodia. The designer, Danh Hong, has many years of experience creating fonts for Khmer and other Southeast
    Asian languages, and is actively involved in the KhmerOS project, dedicated to a vision where Cambodians can learn
    and use computers in their own language.
