It&apos;s Festive! But don&apos;t let the name fool youâ€¦ It&apos;s a fun script font (that includes a Roman stylistic set) accompanied by an assortment of exciting ornamental dingbats suitable for any occasion where festivities abound from New Years to Graduation, Baby &amp; Wedding Showers, Thanksgiving, and much more, even Sports.

The base font works well with bodies of copy, while the alternate glyphs can be used to swap out individual characters to give a custom, hand written look. Be sure to scroll thru to see all the stylistic sets.

<p>
It comes with Latin Character sets including Western, Central, and Vietnamese language support.
