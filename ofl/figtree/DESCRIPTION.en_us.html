<p>Figtree is a clean yet friendly geometric sans serif font for usage in web and mobile apps. It's light-hearted and crisp when used for text, yet still retains some punch when used in uppercase â€“ perfect for buttons and short labels. The thicker weights have a distinctly friendlier character, great for headlines of more personable brands.</p>

<p>Figtree comes as a variable font with 7 legacy weights, light through black, and supports 280+ Latin languages. In November 2022, the italic style is added to complete the family.</p>
