<p>Designed to integrate with the character of the FirefoxOS, the Fira typefaces also aim to cover the legibility needs for a large range of handsets varying in screen quality and rendering.</p>

<p>The Fira font family comes in a <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Fira+Sans">Sans Serif</a> with 4 weights (Light, Regular, Medium and Bold) all accompanied by italic styles. The package also includes this Mono Spaced variant with 3 weights (Regular, Medium, Bold.)</p>
