Designed to integrate with the character of the Mozilla FirefoxOS, the Fira typefaces also aim to cover the legibility needs for a large range of handsets varying in screen quality and rendering.
</p>
<p>
The Fira font family comes in 3 widths, all accompanied by italic styles. 
The package also includes a <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Fira+Mono">Mono Spaced variant</a>.

This project is led by <a href="https://carrois.com">Carrois</a>, a type foundry based in Berlin.
