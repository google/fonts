<p>Fjord is a serif typeface, originally designed with printed books in mind, and particularly intended for long texts in small print sizes. 
Fjord features sturdy construction, prominent serifs, low-contrast modulation and long elegant ascenders and descenders relative to the 'x' height. 
Fjord performs well in sizes form 12 px and higher but because of its original design and careful detailing, 
Fjord can also be a distinctive font choice for larger text headlines and in corporate design. 
Fjord is inspired by the feeling found in both renaissance and contemporary typeface design.</p>
