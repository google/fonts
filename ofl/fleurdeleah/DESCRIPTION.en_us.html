FleurDeLeah is a formal script with a floral flavour. One of the first fonts to incorporate embellishment design elements within the letterforms.

<p>
Use it sparingly for captions and short phrases and as with any script font, but <strong>never</strong> use it in all caps. Enjoy!

It comes with Latin Character sets including Western, Central, and Vietnamese language support.
