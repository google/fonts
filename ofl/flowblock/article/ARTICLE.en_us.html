<p>Flow is a font family built for abstracting content and code for design mockups, wireframing, presentations, and websites. It's not perfect, but neither are your wireframes. Flow has sub-pixels, artifacts, overlaps and other imperfections.</p>
<p>Flow comes in three styles: <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Flow+Circular">Circular</a>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Flow+Rounded">Rounded</a> and Block.</p>

<h3>Flow and Redacted: Check out these new options for wireframes and other early-stage designs</h3>

<p>Give your simulated text a realistic look while making it easy to add copy later on with Dan Ross’s <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=Dan+Ross">Flow Fonts</a> and Christian Naths’s <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=Redacted">Redacted</a>.</p>
<p>Showing text in an early-stage wireframe can be distracting, even if it’s just Lorem ipsum placeholder copy. After all, a successful wireframe is clean and simple, with just enough information to communicate an idea. But how do you convey “this is text” without showing text?</p>
<p>One popular technique is to draw shapes that resemble a block of redacted text. (Redacted text is usually used as a security or privacy measure in a document to make certain words unreadable.)</p>
<p>Another technique is to use handwritten scribbles. This creates a sketch-like look that’s especially suited to quick concepting.</p>
