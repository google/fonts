<p>Flow is a font family built for abstracting content and code for design mockups, wireframing, presentations, and websites. It's not perfect, but neither are your wireframes. Flow has sub-pixels, artifacts, overlaps and other imperfections.</p>

<p>Flow comes in three styles: Circular <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Flow+Rounded">Rounded</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Flow+Block">Block</a>.</p>
