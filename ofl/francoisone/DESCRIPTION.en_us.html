<p>Francois One is a reworking of traditional sans serif gothic display typeface forms. In Francois One, the earlier letter forms have been digitised and then reshaped for use as a webfont, the counters have been opened up a little and the stems optimised for use as bold display font in modern web browsers. Slanted stem terminals have been added to give the face added visual play.</p>

<p>Updated February 2023 with Summer of Type.</p>
