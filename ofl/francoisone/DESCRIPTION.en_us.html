<p>Francois One is a reworking of traditional sans serif gothic display typeface forms. 
In Francois One, the earlier letter forms have been digitised and then reshaped for use as a webfont, the counters have been opened up a little and the stems optimised for use as bold display font in modern web browsers. 
Slanted stem terminals have been added to give the face added visual play. Suitable for personal brand identity and for achieving an informal look</p>
