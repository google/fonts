<h3>Wonky, goofy, playful, elegant and a workhorse: Meet a new breed of “Old Style” typeface</h3>
<p>Fraunces is a variable font that offers a variety of styles for text and display typography.</p>
<p>In 2018, Google Fonts commissioned Flavia Zimbardi and Phaedra Charles of <a href="https://undercase.xyz/">Undercase Type</a> to make a new <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/display">display</a> typeface that would demonstrate the power and promise of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/variable_fonts">variable fonts</a> with a sense of humor.</p>
<p>Their solution to this challenge is inspired by the early 20th century <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/typeface">typefaces</a> such as <a href="http://fontreviewjournal.com/windsor/">Windsor</a>, Souvenir, and the Cooper Series.</p>

<p>“Fraunces probably leans a little more (pun intended) towards the mannerism in Windsor than any of the others, but they all have some qualities common with each other. Those typefaces were meant to evoke a hand-drawn quality more appropriate for display advertising. The leaning ‘n’ in Windsor is a very distinctive characteristic of this style and is probably the most direct comparison. Fraunces does something unique by creating a design space that incorporates both heavy inky qualities, as well as thinner, more refined and delicate qualities seen in the lighter <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/weight">weights</a> of Windsor. The italic pairing for Fraunces is also very distinct and draws influences from Cooper Nouveau, which blends Art Nouveau influences,” said Phaedra Charles.</p>
<p>Using variable font technology gives more flexibility; “Fraunces embraces the new variable font technology with four axes–softness, weight, wonk, and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/optical_sizes">optical size</a>–making its use much more versatile and customizable than what any typeface released in the 1970’s.”</p>
