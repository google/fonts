Freeman is a re-interpretation of the traditional display sans serif gothic typeface where some elements of the handwritten style are added to give a bit more personality to the design. In Freeman, the counters have opened up a little, and the stems are optimized for use as a bold display font in modern web browsers. Sloped stem terminals have been added to give the face added visual play.</p>

Freeman language support now includes African Latin and full coverage of Vietnamese, in addition to all Western, Central, and South-Eastern European languages.
