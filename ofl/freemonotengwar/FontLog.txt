FreeMonoTengwar: FontLog.txt
============================

The FreeMonoTengwar font is based on the FreeMono.sfd of the 2009-01-04
GNU FreeFont. It includes many portions of FreeMono.sfd without
alteration, but adds the tengwar script to the Personal Use Area U+E000
-- U+E07F according the ConScript Unicode Registry, see
http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/tengwar.html and taking into
account later additions by Johan Winge.

Furthermore, the font makes use of some ligatures. These ligatures are
provided either by the Graphite smart rendering technology or by the
OpenType smart rendering technology.

For more detailed informations, see: http://freetengwar.sourceforge.net/


Statement of Purpose
====================

The Free Tengwar Font Project aims at developing a family of general
purpose fonts that cover J. R. R. Tolkien's tengwar script and that are
compatible with the Unicode standard. Additional aims are tools and
documentation for the use of such fonts. Compatibility with Unicode
means that these fonts' tengwar glyphs will not be mapped over any other
Unicode character. Instead, they are mapped on the Personal Use Area of
Unicode.


Files and their suffixes
========================

TrueType fonts for immediate consumption are the files with the .ttf
(TrueType Font) suffix.  These are ready to use in Xwindows based
systems using FreeType, on Mac OS, and Windows.

The files with .sfd (Spline Font Database) are in FontForge's native
format, the free outline font editor by George Williams
<http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/>. The files with .gdl (Graphite
Description Language) describe the Graphite features of the font. The
.sfd and .gdl files have been used for editing these fonts. The file
with .py is a python script that will generate the fonts from the .sfd
and .gdl files (if certain other requirements are met, see the section
Editing and Building).


Installing FreeMonoTengwar
==========================

FreeMonoTengwar can be used in any modern operating system, even if some
ligatures might not work.

This document explains how to install FreeFont on some common systems.


	* Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP; Vista

		Vista:
			1) From the Start menu, open Control Panels
			2) Drag-n-drop font files onto Fonts control panel
			You may get a dialog saying
				"Windows needs your permission to continue"
			a) Click Continue

		95/98/NT:
			The font installation is similar to Vista.

			In order to use OpenType, users of Windows 95, 98 and NT 4.0
			can install Adobe's 'Type Manager Light'.  It is available
			for download without cost from Adobe's web site.

			Otherwise, use the TrueType versions.

	* Mac OS X

		Installing on Mac OS X consists of moving the .ttf files to
		either /Library/Fonts/  or  ~/Library/Fonts/ depending on
		whether they should be available to all users on your system or
		just to yourself.

	* UNIX/GNU/Linux/BSD Systems

		FreeFont works with any system using the free font rasterizer
		FreeType <http://www.freetype.org/>.

		KDE local installation:
			Users of KDE can install .ttf files on a per-user basis
			using the KDE Control Center module "kcmfontinst", which
			may appear in the menu as

				Settings -> System Administration -> Font Installer

			This is especially helpful for developers and testers.


		Generic X-windows:

			1) Fetch the freefont-ttf.tar.gz package with Free UCS
			outline fonts in the TrueType format.

			2) Unpack TrueType fonts into a suitable directory, e.g.
			/usr/local/share/fonts/default/TrueType/

			3) If you have chosen any other directory, make sure the
			directory you used to install the fonts is listed in the
			path searched by the X Font Server by editing the config
			file in /etc/X11/.

			In some systems, you list the directory in the item
			"catalogue=" in the file /etc/X11/fs/config.

			4) Run ttmkfdir in the directory where you unpacked the
			fonts.


Coverage and differences from GNU FreeMono
==========================================

In addition to the Unicode Personal Use Area tengwar, FreeMonoTengwar
covers a wide range of characters, including Latin Extended characters,
the IPA, Greek, Runic, or mathematical symbols. However, some character
blocks of the original GNU FreeFont FreeMono font have been removed:
Kyrillic, Armenian, Georgian, Hebrew, Box Drawing characters and
Braille.

A few GNU FreeMono characters have been changed so they fit in better
with tengwar text:

	* U+10fb: GEORGIAN PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR,
	* U+2058: FOUR DOT PUNCTUATION,
	* U+205d: TRICOLON,
	* U+25cc: DOTTED CIRCLE,
	* U+2e2d: FIVE DOT MARK,
	* U+2e2c: SQUARED FOUR DOT PUNCTUATION,
	* U+2e31: WORD SEPARATOR MIDDLE DOT.


Editing and building
====================

Get FontForge, the free outline font editor by George Williams
<http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/>. Edit FreeMonoTengwar.sfd, then
generate fonts.

Adding Graphite support to the font is a little bit trickier. It
requires an installation of Sharon Correll's free Graphite Compiler
<http://scripts.sil.org/RenderingGraphite>. Note that the Windows
GraphiteCompiler_2_4.exe runs well on Wine <http://www.winehq.org/>. On
Mac OS X it might be easier to run GraphiteCompiler_2_4.exe through
Wine than building the Unix grcompiler.

After both the Graphite compiler and FontForge are installed, go to a
directory that contains the four following files:

	FreeMonoTengwar.sfd
	FreeMonoTengwar.gdl
	FreeMonoTengwar.mif
	makefonts.py

Then run the following command:

	fontforge -script makefonts.py

This will generate a bunch of files. The most important one is
FreeMonoTengwar.ttf, a version of FreeMonoTengwar with Graphite
support.

Note that makefonts.py also creates FreeMonoTengwar-embedding, a
smaller version of FreeMonoTengwar. This step requires another small
utility, taviso's free ttf2eot <http://code.google.com/p/ttf2eot/>.

If you are using the Windows GraphiteCompiler_2_4.exe, then the script
makefonts.py will probably not find the Graphite compiler. This means
it will only create the file FreeMonoTengwar_nogr.ttf without Graphite
support. Two solutions: Either don't worry and use the Graphite
compiler manually. Or create your own "grcompiler" that will redirect
to the Windows GraphiteCompiler_2_4.exe. If for instance you have
installed GraphiteCompiler_2_4.exe on Mac OS X using Wine, then your
"grcompiler" could be an executable file that contains but the
following line:

	wine ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/Graphite\ Compiler/GrCompiler.exe "$@"

* Yannis Haralambous <yannis.haralambous AT enst-bretagne.fr> and John
  Plaice <plaice AT omega.cse.unsw.edu.au>

Yannis Haralambous and John Plaice are the authors of Omega typesetting
system, <http://omega.enstb.org/>. Omega is an extension of TeX.
Its first release, aims primarily at improving TeX's multilingual abilities.
In Omega all characters and pointers into data-structures are 16-bit wide,
instead of 8-bit, thereby eliminating many of the trivial limitations of TeX.
Omega also allows multiple input and output character sets, and uses
programmable filters to translate from one encoding to another, to perform
contextual analysis, etc. Internally, Omega uses the universal 16-bit Unicode
standard character set, based on ISO-10646. These improvements not only make
it a lot easier for TeX users to cope with multiple or complex languages,
like Arabic, Indic, Khmer, Chinese, Japanese or Korean, in one document, but
will also form the basis for future developments in other areas, such as
native color support and hypertext features. ... Fonts for UT1 (omlgc family)
and UT2 (omah family) are under development: these fonts are in PostScript
format and visually close to Times and Helvetica font families. 
Omega fonts are available subject to GPL

* Young U. Ryu <ryoung AT utdallas.edu>

Young Ryu is the author of Txfonts, a set of mathematical symbols
designed to accompany text typeset in Times or its variants. In the
documentation, Young adresses the design of mathematical symbols: "The
Adobe Times fonts are thicker than the CM fonts. Designing math fonts
for Times based on the rule thickness of Times = , , + , / , < ,
etc. would result in too thick math symbols, in my opinion. In the TX
fonts, these glyphs are thinner than those of original Times
fonts. That is, the rule thickness of these glyphs is around 85% of
that of the Times fonts, but still thicker than that of the CM fonts."
TX fonts are are distributed under the GNU public license (GPL).

* K.H. Hussain <hussain AT kfri.org> and R. Chitrajan

`Rachana' in Malayalam means `to write', `to create'. Rachana Akshara Vedi,
a team of socially committed information technology professionals and
philologists, has applied developments in computer technology and desktop
publishing to resurrect the Malayalam language from the disorder,
fragmentation and degeneration it had suffered since the attempt to adapt
the Malayalam script for using with a regular mechanical typewriter, which
took place in 1967-69. K.H. Hussein at the Kerala Forest Research Institute
has released "Rachana Normal" fonts with approximately 900 glyphs required
to typeset traditional Malayalam. R. Chitrajan apparently encoded the
glyphs in the OpenType table.

In 2008, the Malayalam ranges in FreeSerif were updated under the advise 
and supervision of Hiran Venugopalan of Swathanthra Malayalam Computing,
to reflect the revised edition Rachana_04.

In December 2005 the team at www.gnowledge.org released a set of two
Unicode pan-Indic fonts: "Samyak" and "Samyak Sans". "Samyak" font
belongs to serif style and is an original work of the team; "Samyak
Sans" font belongs to sans serif style and is actually a compilation
of already released Indic fonts (Gargi, Padma, Mukti, Utkal, Akruti
and ThendralUni). Both fonts are based on Unicode standard. You can
download the font files (released under GNU/GPL License) from

Change Log
==========

2010-06-11 j. 'mach' wust
	* FreeMonoTengwar:

	New ligature glyph tehtaI_tehtaE, in order to display the
	combination of dot above and andaith attested in Parma Eldalamberon
	20. This ligature is only added after automatic carrier insertion.
	This means there will still be automatic carrier insertion between
	an tehtaI and tehtaE. That is because the new combination is only
	intended for full writing modes, whereas carrier insertion is only
	intended for tehtar modes.

	Updates to the Graphite smarts so they run smoothely on the new
	grcompiler.

	The graphite font features that can be chosen from have now ssXX
	IDs. Like this, they work in Firefox.

2010-06-11 j. 'mach' wust
	* FreeMonoTengwar:

	Added AAT support and enhanced Graphite support.

	Removed nested glyph references (this prevents buggy behaviour in Mac OS X 10.6).

2010-01-20 Johan Winge
	* FreeMonoTengwar:

	Graphite support added.

2009-12-30 j. 'mach' wust
	* FreeMonoTengwar.sfd:

	Added ligatures aha_tinco, hwesta_tinco, silme_aha.

	Removed Cyrillic, Armenian, Hebrew, Georgian, Box Drawing, Braille characters.

	Resized some punctuation so they fit better in with the tengwar. This means that some original GNUFreeFont FreeMono characters have been changed. This concerns the characters U+10fb: GEORGIAN PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR, U+2058: FOUR DOT PUNCTUATION, U+205d: TRICOLON, U+25cc: DOTTED CIRCLE, U+2e2d: FIVE DOT MARK, U+2e2c: SQUARED FOUR DOT PUNCTUATION, U+2e31: WORD SEPARATOR MIDDLE DOT.

	[Also set PANOSE property "proportion" to the value "any".]

2009-12-12 j. 'mach' wust
	* FreeMonoTengwar.sfd:

	Several characters added. [Tengwar punctuation and ZWJ_longCarrier ligature.]

2009-10-03 j. 'mach' wust
	* FreeMonoTengwar.sfd:

	Generated new TTF and OTF files with the OpenType option checked in the options section of FontForge's Generate Font Dialog.

2009-09-12 j. 'mach' wust
	* FreeMonoTengwar.sfd:

	Created from FreeMono.sfd with additional Personal Use Area
	tengwar.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Kerning for Latin and Cyrillic fairly complete in Serif faces.
	Complete in sense that it looks pretty good under Pango for
		English French German Spanish Polish Czech Latvian
	But have not done Vietnamese (will require many more entries).
	I adjust roman and italic, then copy tables by hand to bold and
	bolditalic.
	Misgiving: bolditalic is much too crammed
	Overall, I may have over-kerned.  (A difficult temptation to master.)

	Made Cyrillic hooked e U+04BC-F to look less goofy.

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Based on assertion on Pechatnyj Dvor's web site, Cyrillic Fita
	U+0472-3 and "Barred O" U+04E8-9 are different styles the same letter,
	and the fact that the tilde in the O never looked good in Sans, I
	made them all barred O's.

	Strove to make Euro look more like the EC logo design, while making
	glyph fit better with the design of its face.  Bug #3576: Euro design
		https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?23576

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd:

	Adjustments mostly to GPOS tables having to do with Vietnamese marks.
	The WAZU Vietnamese test page looks pretty good in Sans now.
	Still not thrilled with below-dot when it appears with a mark over
	e.g. U+0102. Pango positions one or the other but not both.

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Extensive modification of GPOS lookup tables for mark positioning.
	I think they're now all functional (except styled Mono faces have none).
	Also added lots of marks to faces that didn't have them, and also
	fiddled with Combining Diacritical Marks.

2008-11-10 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Made one combining mark really combining

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	Made a few combining characters to be zero-width in Mono,
	Added them to other styles.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Figured out why below marks in Thai weren't working in the lowest
	letters.  I think Pango and other font renderers ignore 'blwm'. 
	However, 'mark' works.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Tweeks to Thai marks

2008-11-09 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Several bugfixes in Thai, mostly having to do with mark placement and
	ligatures.  Implemented ru-saraaa and lu-saraaa with ligatures.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	added and named dottedcircle (used by Pango to render
	combining mark base)

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Tweeks to Coptic, after viewing more papyrus samples and web pages.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Weight of Coptic small letters made to match that of Latin and Greek ones.

2008-11-08 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Made Coptic to comply better with
		http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Test_Coptic.html
	Made a flourish at foot of letters with long diagonal.

	More tweeks to Coptic; put in a mark lookup table.
	
	Note: for small letters I made scaled references to captials.
	Results in those letters looking quite light next to the capitals and
	next to small Latin letters.  Also, there are a few variant forms for
	capitals (Unicode samples don't show this).  It would be good to
	re-work

	Added Coptic alphabet in u+2C80-2CB1 and u+03E2-u+03EF, drawn/built by
	me, based on Unicode samples, TeX font copte, and scans at WikiPedia.

2008-11-07 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Further tweeks to dieresis in Greek and Cyrillic

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

2008-11-04 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Added a few Cyrillic Extended-B letters seen in web pages while looking
	for Glagolitic text.

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	Added a few old Cyrillic characters.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Several corrections and tweeks to Glagolitic.
	Still missing six slots from Unicode, but don't see them in the TeX
	fonts.
	On the other hand, several on-line Glagolitic pages (bibles etc) don't
	seem to use these.  Maybe it's OK as-is.

2008-11-03 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Added lowercase range to Glagolitic, as a facile scaling of the
	uppercase.

	Added letter to Glagolitic, scaled range.

2008-11-02 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Replaced fraktur bold from Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols with that
	from TX Fonts by Young Ryu.
	One concern: letter k is damaged (in both medium and bold).  I just
	hacked something up.
	
	Added Glagolitic "round type" font (Croation capitols only) from the
	collection of Croatian fonts for LaTeX by Darko Zubrinić
	ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/languages/croatian/
	http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb17-1/tb50zubr.pdf
	
	Several letters are missing besides the small letters.

	* FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd:

	A couple of Thai references got obliqued twice.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	By popular demand, removed 'ears' from Greek Upsilon and Psi.
	Copied resulting glyphs to Serif Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Some pointwise cleanup of main Tamil range

	Tried some things with lookups.  Didn't make much headway.

2008-11-01 Stevan_White
	* FreeMono.sfd:

	somehow made a letter with wrong width

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Added similar lookups and ligatures to Thai ranges.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Lookups now work no worse than those for other Thai fonts, at least
	in Pango.  Still perplexed by behaviour of "Required" lookups.

	For Thai, made ligatures and lookups for yoying and thothan combined
	with a lower vowel.  These work well.
	Attempted looksups for saraaa with ru and lu, and for saraam. 
	Not working.

	Cleaned up a few of the Bengali ligatures

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd:

	Tweek Thai

2008-10-31 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Fixed ligatures and mark positioning for Hanunóo.
	Problem with ligatures: Gnome pango doesn't do 'rlig', only 'liga'

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Changed lookup table scripts for Devanagari and Bengali.
	Find Problems -> ATT found several problems showing lookups acting on
	glyphs that weren't listed in the script ranges, including dev2, bng2
	(why not deva and beng, I don't know).
	
	danda and doubledanda of Devanagari I understand are to be shared among
	Indic scripts.  So included bng2 and dev2 in the 'aalt' table for those.
	
	The 'init' and 'half' tables for Bengali made active for bng2.
	
	The 'locl' table for Bengali didn't do anything I could see: It mapped
	the Devanagari danda to itself, and the doubledanda to itself.  Deleted.

	Cleaned up some kern tables.
	adjustments of under 5 EM are invisible.  Some others I just didn't like.
	Some were putting a letter beneath another, with is wrong.

	* FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd:

	Added Thai

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Changes to mark positioning lookups, esp. in Italic.

	Tweeks regarding Armenian and lookups

	* FreeSansBold.sfd:

	Added Armenian ligatures FB13-FB17 with lookups
	Also made a historical ligature ('hlig') table for u+0587.
	
	Toward bug #15183: missing characters from Armenian range
	https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?15183

	* FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Added Armenian ligatures, lookups.  Cleaned up contours.

	* FreeSans.sfd:

	Added 5 Armenian ligatures to U+FB13 – FB17, and made corresponding
	'liga' lookup.  Found there one ligature u+0587 that according to
		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_alphabet
	
	"in new orthography the և character is not a typographical ligature anymore, and must never be treated as such. It is a distinct letter and has its place in the new alphabetic sequence."
	So moved this out of the 'liga' lookup and into a new 'hlig' lookup.

2008-10-26 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Lots of improvements to Thai.
	Completely revised letter spacing in Italic, and fiddled with combining
	marks in all.
	Still aren't working quite right, especially in Italic.
	Still need to work over digits (in Bold they aren't even bold yet)

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Bold Thai : added (painstakingly) constructed glyphs, lookups
	roman Thai: tweeks
	Italic Thai: tweeks (Note this still has multiple problems)

2008-10-25 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	WAZU says
	http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Fonts_Hanunoo.html
	
	MPH 2B Damase doesn't support the consonant-vowel ligatures necessary
	to render Buhid writing.
	
	OK, so I made 'mark' lookups for combining marks and a bunch of
	ligatures in an 'rlig' lookup.  The latter still not working:
	don't know why.
	
	Made page to match the example of the combining forms at
	http://www.omniglot.com/writing/hanunoo.htm

2008-10-24 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Not sure how this got broken or how to fix it.

	* FreeSansBold.sfd:

	a few more improvements.
	
	One problem with the Mathematical Alphanumeric area is, one must
	remember to change it any time another face is altered...

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd:

	Several improvements and additions to Sans faces (mostly in Greek) from

	Wrote script to check if glyph encodings were in stated ranges, fixed
	most discrepancies.
	
	There were a bunch of incompletely deleted characters in several faces.
	
	Sans: found several other problems in the process
	# Tamil
	Four slots labelled 0BDA-D have glyphs, not in Unicode.  also 0BE1
	I think they are misplaced; added 0010 to each of them
	
	# Devanagari
	Slot labelled U+093B is not in Unicode--can't find glyph: deleted
	likewise 094F (may have been meant to be 0954)
	0955, 0973-0976
	
	0954 should be a combining mark, but it appears on the wrong side of 0.
	0971 was just wrong--made into simple dot.
	0972 is also wrong--made my own Candra A.
	
	# Gujarati
	Slots labelled 0AE4-5 are not in Unicode; seem not to belong at all.
	Deleted.  2800 is a dup of 2790.  Deleted
	
	Serif: phillipine_double u1736 was misplaced
	
	A bunch of the Math Alphanumeric symbols are empty in the standard,
	because they're represented elsewhere.  These should be deleted
	First need to make style consistent with existing symbols.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	* FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Ran script to find mis-numbered glyphs.  Several were simply typos,
	some offset by one.

	* FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Numerous cases of glyphs in Private Use area incorrectly assigned
	Unicode numbers and names.  Gave all -1 for Unicode and named like
	"slot.XXXX".

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Adapted Mahjong Tiles from George Douros' Unicode Symbols font.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Fixed one mis-numberd character in Latin Extended-B

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Fixed several mis-numbered characters.

	* FreeSansBold.sfd:

	SansBold: one Georgian letter with no name, one Zapf Dingbat was
	unnumbered
	ATT test shows a bunch of problems with Gurmukhi and 'blwf' table
	indeed shows those letters at 0x10000+
	Sans names them like uni0A30_uni0A4D.blwf: they are in range
	ECC6 to ED06
	
	I meant to move this range into Private Use in last release, and
	missed it.  So now it is moved, into same range as Sans.
	
	Both Sans and SansBold in nukt table for Gurmukhi have duplicate
	entries for uni0A15 uni0A3C.  Deleted dups.

	* FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	fixed a number of Unassigned Code Points in Greek Extended

	One spurious letter in Letterlike Symbols

2008-09-16 Stevan_White
	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd:

	Lots of additions: unless otherwise noted, they are from George Duros'
	fonts Analecta, Music, and Unicode (haven't got final confirmation of
	the eligibility of these glyphs, so this is just for testing.)
	
	Added some combining marks, fiddled a bit.  In both Serif & Mono, tried
	to get a key symbol characters to fit inside the key combining mark
	
	Serif
	Got rid of ears on Upsilon

	Serif, Mono: tweeked some bugs in extensible brackets & integrals
	
	Serif: Vietnamese o circumflex: accent was a bit high. fixed.
	
	MonoBoldOblique OTF build
		uni213b intersects self
	
	Generation of TT fonts complains about several things to stderr,
	including:
	
	SerifBold: "There exists a 'fpgm' code that seems incompatible with FontForge's. Instructions generated will be of lower quality. If legacy hinting is to be scrapped, it is suggested to clear the `fpgm` and repeat autoinstructing. It will be then possible to append user's code to FontForge's 'fpgm', but due to possible future updates, it is extremely advised to use high numbers for user's functions."
	Probably has been there since I first copied the TT instructions in. 
	Just repeated the copying process carefully, and the warning went away.
	
	Serif:  "FindMatchingHVEdge fell into an impossible position"
	        fixed a bunch of point too close
	
	REMAINING PROBLEM in Serif TT build
		"MonotonicFindAlong: Never found our spline."

	* FreeMono.sfd:

	Built set of APL symbols.

2008-08-30 Stevan_White
	* FreeSans.sfd:

	Un-linked references in uni02B2 and uni02B5, because when validating the
	TrueType version, FontForge gave an error "is drawn in wrong direction".
	I suspect a bug in FontForge.  Other similar glyphs make no errors.

	Fixed missing extrema in TrueType.
	These were the last cases being reported by validate in all the faces.

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	fixed last missing extrema in TrueType

	* Makefile:

	restructured validation to look in a directory

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd:

	Fixed missing extrema in TrueType versions

2008-08-15 Stevan_White
	* FreeSans.sfd:

	Same problem with uni0A83 as with bn_llikaar.  Just made zero-width.

2008-08-14 Stevan_White
	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Glyph bn_llikaar, U+09E3 BENGALI VOWEL SIGN VOCALIC LL,
	has right bound positioned far into the negative.  Causes a warning in
	FontForge when opening OTF version.
	Comparing with other fonts supporting Bengali, found no others that
	do this.
	Serif makes glyph width 0 (which sounds right according to Unicode)
	and puts glyph wholly to left of 0.  But, I haven't found this letter
	in text anywhere.  I wonder if it is really used in writing.

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Further TrueType validation fixes. 
	Sans still has two glyps in wrong direction.

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Fixed more TrueType problems...all missing extrema in TTF validation

2008-08-13 Stevan_White
	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	fixed all the TrueType validation problems of type "intersects itself"
	and all but two of the "wrong directions", as well as a lot of
	"missing extrema".  But there remain hundreds of missing extrema in the
	TrueType version.
	Also, bn_llikaar in Sans and Oblique still has a problem in OTF version.

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd, FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd:

	Made .ttf files to validate.  Other faces have many more problems still.

2008-08-12 Stevan_White
	* FreeMonoOblique.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Continuing to make OTF versions validate.
	
	* FreeMonoOblique.sfd:
		lots of missing points at extrema
	* FreeSerif.sfd:
		12 wrong directions, 1 missing extrema
	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd:
		many missing points at extrema, 1 self-intersecting
	
	What was wrong: in several oblique cases, an already-italic glyph was
	made more italic, thereby fouling up extrema (although why it passed
	validation in the SFD I don't know).  Some glyphs were
	overly-complicated with many near points.  Cleaned up, rounded to int.
	
	Remaining problem: OTF FreeSansOblique FreeSans. one Bengali glyph in
	each whose advance width and htmx don't match.
	
	Moral of story: validate the OTF and TTF versions too before a release.

	* FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Reverse a mistake from last commit: somehow this file was converted to
	quadratic, or something.

2008-08-11 Stevan_White
	* FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd:

	Found that SFD files that validated produced OpenType files that don't.
	These represent the easy fixes.  Some were result of conversion to
	quadratic; some shouldn't have validated in the SFD...
	
	* MonoBoldOblique: uni0250 missing pts at extrema [reference glyph rotated...]
	* Sans:            uni0AC4 wrong direction [simplified, rounded to int]
	* SansOblique:     uni01EA wrong direction [rounded to int]
	* SerifBold:       uni023f wrong direction [round to int]
	* SerifBoldItalic: uni0245 missing pts at extrema [ungrouped ref, added extrema]

2008-08-06 Stevan_White
	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	Re-set font metrics, which were somehow making uneven vertical spacing.

2008-06-22 Steve White
	* FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd:

	Made to validate

	* ranges.py:

	Brought more into line with OpenType
	Added some ranges
	Fixed bug with ranges outside of font

	* CREDITS:

	3 new ranges

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Cyrillic: tweeked accents for consistency, and for readability in small
	sizes.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Thanna range: tweeking

	Thaana range: Scaled up by about 15%, raised by 100EM, tightened
	some of the diacritics to get inside 900 to -300 EM limits.

	* FreeSans.sfd:

	Added Old Persian and Ugaritic from MPH2BDamase font.

2008-06-21 Steve White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Added Tai Le range adapted from MPH2BDamase font.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd:

	Added some ancient Greek numerals from Tempora to high Unicode area,
	(partly just to show it can now be done.)

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Couple of tweeks putting glyphs above -300EM.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Surgery to Thai letter 'tho than', u+0e10, to push it above -300 EM.
	This makes Thai range completely between 900 and -300 EM.

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Many auxilary characters (esp. for Malayalam, Bengla, and Tamil)
	representing ligatures and alternative forms without their own Unicode,
	were moved from
	ranges above 0xFFFF (which ought to have been slots for other defined
	Unicode ranges) into the Private Use area.
	
	In Serif, I segregated the scripts, in Sans it was hard to see where one
	began and another ended, so I moved them en masse.
	
	Note several problems with wrongly-named characters:
	I already re-named glyph570 and glyph582.
	But there are others with names starting with A...

	* FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Fixed (I hope the last) problem with scripts in lookups
	Find Problems -> ATT (all selected) finds multiple issues,
	
	* FreeSansBold.sfd:
	In addition to script 'guru', added 'gur2' to the scripts for these
	lookups
		'nukt' Nukta forms in Gurmukhi
		'blwf' Below Base Forms in Gurmukhi
		'pstf' Post Base Forms in Gurmukhi
		'blws' Below Base Substitutions in Gurmukhi
		'abvs' Above Base Substitutions in Gurmukhi
		'psts' Post Base Substitutions in Gurmukhi
	
	* FreeSansOblique.sfd:
	In addition to script 'beng', added 'bng2' to the scripts for the lookup
		'half' Half Forms in Bengali
	
	Moreover, the lookup
		'aalt' Access All Alternates in Latin
	contains only Bengali letters.
	Re-named as Bengali, made to work on beng, bng2 scripts

2008-06-20 Steve White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Scaled Sinhala range.
	Remedies bug #23656: Sinhala letters over-sized

	Mostly messing with Greek Extended accents again.
	re-positioned ypogegrammani on advice of Alexey Kryukov
	Put prosgegrammani beneath main letters in Mono, to make narrower glyphs
	Implemented more distinction between tonos and acute.

2008-06-19 Steve White
	* FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd:

	Completed fit of Mono to 800 to -200 EM.

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	Set Metrics to recommended values

	* FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	Now Mono Oblique, as well as roman and Bold, are within 800 to -200 EM.
	Just BoldOblique to go.

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd:

	More toward fitting to 800 to -200 EM.
	Basically, reduced Georgian by 92%.
	Also made an over-all offset, so Georgian is somehow centered (Bold...I
	guess I already did this in roman).
	Want to also do an emboldening to make stroke like rest of font, but
	current FontForge has a nasty crash that loses data on this function.

	* FreeMono.sfd:

	In effort to make fit in 800 to -200 EM,
	Scaled Georgian by 92%, centered on 600 wide box.
	Next: Embolden a bit.

2008-06-18 Steve White
	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	Toward making all glyphs lie between -200 and 800 EM.

	Fiddled globally with spacing of small letters.
	Unclear on diacritics 485-6, unhappy with breve.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Started implementing TemporaLCGUni in Greek ranges.
	
	Replaced 3DC-3E1 from Tempora, because I thought they looked nicer and
	more like the other existing FreeFont glyphs.
	Replaced 3DA-B from Tempora, because they look more like Unicode
	samples, and nicer.
	Added 03f3-4, 03F7-F.
	Prefer my own lunate epsilon.
	Replaced Phi and Omega from Tempora.
	These plainly fit the other FreeFont glyphs better than the origninals.
	(How did this happen?)
	
	In bold, replaced U+03D7
	
	Copied lbbar u+2114

	Small italic greek--replaced most except phi, psi, omega
	
	Based on new information, broke the identification of oxia with Latin
	acute.

		Private Dictionary
		Elements in BlueValues/OtherBlues array are disordered

		(Change BlueFuzz)
		StemSnapV does not contain StdVW value.
	So I ordered the array, and based on other slanted fonts,
	removed StemSnapV.
	
	Note however, I still think the two top Blues lines are too close
	But I don't even know what the second-to-top line is meant to do.

	Added mark tables to Sans.  Improvement, but there are questions...

	* FreeSans.sfd:

	Tidied some Gurmukhi glyphs, validated.

	Deleted ranges for Oriya, Kannada, on account of

	Serif: Telugu range missing many characters; many wrong

	Got a copy of the original Tikkana font,
	Copied in remaining consonants and vowels that I could find there.
	I think one vowel 0C55 is missing according to unicode).
	Strangely, the Telugu digits are alo missing.
	In Tikkana, the default "checkmark" structural mark is missing from many
	consonants, according to Unicode, but is a separate glyph.  I put
	the checkmark on.
	This, and scaled up by 150% and cleaned up intersecting glyphs and
	many unnecessary points.

2008-05-08 Steve White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Made sure all the half rings in Combining Diacriticals and Spacing
	Modifiers were really half rings  (J. Poon had complained about this)

	Filled out General Punctuation

2008-04-30 Steve White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Added Hanunóo script, with characters based on those in
	font MPH2BDamase, on request from the maintainer of that font,
	http://packages.debian.org/sid/ttf-mph-2b-damase
	
	Glyphs are simple vector strokes.  Could be a little more uniform.

	Added Buginese script "Lontara", with characters based on those in
	font MPH2BDamase, on request from the maintainer of that font,
	http://packages.debian.org/sid/ttf-mph-2b-damase
	
	Note the glyphs are pretty rough, clearly a digitization of handwriting.
	I just cleaned them up, and corrected discrepancies with Unicode,
	and compared with some pictorial samples of the script I could find.

2008-04-29 Steve White
	* ranges.py:

	Improved look a lot--still unhappy with some ranges
	OS/2 seems sometimes bang-on, sometimes unrelated to anything (including
	fontforge's OS/2 listing)

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Much fiddling with Tamil range.
	First scaled to 78% (avoiding the references)
	This gets it in the ballpark height-wise.  [A bit taller than the Latin
	letters, but the stroke is narrower, but then the glyphs are busier.]
	Then had to re-align combined references, the trickiest being the
	halants.
	Checked with other fonts with Tamil text.

2008-04-28 Steve White
	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd:

	Cleanup of control points in Arabic and Thaana

	Scaled whole thing by 93%.
	Shrank the tallest letters 0E42-4 to get them under 900EM.
	Shaved off top of maiek.
	Fiddled with positioning of all accents.
	Made positioning tables for accents.
		Note: unclear these are working correctly
	
	Fixed a bug having to do with character replacements for characters
	named 'ng' and 'nj'; these names had been taken on by other characters.
	
	Made to validate
	
	Unicode positions of two Cyrillic Extended characters were switched.
	Fiddled with a couple of Cyrillic combining diacritics

2008-04-27 Steve White

	(E801-3).  They weren't ligatures or in any other lookup, and they
	weren't present in FreeSerif.

	Unlinked and deleted F6C3, which called itself commaaccent.
	Made some new spacing and non-spacing accents to make up for it.

	Retain for condensed type.
	Others: deleted Latin 'liga' table altogether
	BoldOblique : added j to ij ligature

	Toward J. Poon's Report:
	Except for issues of terminators not always vertical or horizontal,

	Made reference between combining koronis and lenis of Greek Extended.
	In Serif, re-worked combining marks lookup tables, added anchors in 
	Latin, moved so without marks they work in kedit (but now I'm doubting

	testing this?)

2008-04-16 Steve White
	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Adjusting of spacing and accents in Greek

2008-04-14 Steve White
	* FreeMono.sfd:

	FontForge thinks they are in Supplemental Arrows, but they should be
	in Supplemental Math-A

	Named some Greek characters

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd:

	Spacing of some Cyrillic characters

2008-04-13 Steve White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Some fiddling with accents
	'yogh' was too wide

	* FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Character spacing was chaos--tried to improve.  BoldOblique also needs
	it.

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Completed the fix of bug #12798, Greek glyphs with accents to side
	Much mucking with accents here, and fixed a few things that were just
	wrong.

2008-04-12 Steve White
	* FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	Made Mono curly quotes "bent"

	* FreeMono.sfd:

	(nearly) encircle preceding latter

2008-04-11 Steve White
	* FreeMono.sfd:

	Bugfix:
	Had indroduce a glyph of width other than 600, making kterminal not
	recognize it as a monospace font.

2008-04-10 Steve White
	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	More messing with accents.
	Further to bug #12798, Greek glyphs with accents to side
	Much messing with glyphs in Greek Extended range

2008-04-09 Steve White
	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd:

	Revisited Latin-1 and Latin-A accents.
	Glyph B7 was called "periodcentered", but Unicode callse it Mid Dot,
	and the description doesn't refer to the period.  I made it like the
	dot accent.  throughout, and referred L-dot to it.
	
	Also double-checked "commaaccent" characters (some in Unicode called
	cedilla, but the Unicode example shows a comma...mystery)
	
	Also the funny IPA upside-down f often had two bars, incorrectly.
	
	To do:  go through rest of Serif, and Sans

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	Completed re-structuring of stacked Latin accents in Mono.
	Also: lots of associated adjustments of Greek Extended accents.
	(Trying to at least center extremely wide characters on their box)
	Repaired some victems of "find overlaps" sweeps
	Worked on glyphs with apostrope/comma parts
	Corrected a few wrong glyphs.
	
	Trying out a "bent quotes" solution to making primes distinct from
	quotes.

2008-04-08 Steve White
	* FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	Toward reducing overall height
	Did similar process as for Mono, fixing a few errors along the way.
	Also the Greek Extended range was very messed up vertical and
	horizontally.
	Horizonal spacing of the heavily accented Greek is a real problem in
	Mono...
	To do:
		revisit "commaaccent" characters in all faces: do some have 
		edillas?
		some Hebrew glyphs are a little low
		Georgian generally is way out of bounds

2008-04-07 Steve White
	* INSTALL:

	Various updates and corrections, tweeked formatting

	* FreeMonoBold.sfd:

	Tweeking of accents

2008-04-06 Steve White
	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd:

	Re-worked accents in FreeMonoBold.sfd to make Latin ranges lie between
	800 and -200 EM, as with FreeMono.

	* FreeMono.sfd:

	Latin Extended ranges: Implemented new policy of shortening the letters
	of the characters with the highest-stacked accents.
	
	At this point all the Latin glyphs lie betweeen 800 and -200 EM.
	
	Also checked for readability of all the Latin extended letters in xterm.
	(Issue: it chops letters outside their bounding boxes; many accents had
	been a bit outside.  Made sure that if they were chopped, they were at
	least still recognizable.)

2008-04-05 Steve White
	* FreeMono.sfd:

	Following exchange about Mono on freefont-bugs with Joe Wells, who
		> doesn't like the curly quote marks
		> wants combining diacritics to work
		> wants tight line spacing
	
	Trying to reduce font height:
	> exclamdown was below -200
	> Throughout Extended Greek, ypogegrammeni were too low.  Shortened
	glyph, and raised all references.
	> Lots of messing with Latin Extended ranges to make glyphs mostly
	fit into 800 height.  Mostly succeeded.  A couple will get chopped.
	> Messed with "commaaccent" glyphs, which were very low
	> Cyrillic 04B1 had a tail that was incorrectly low
	> Much mucking with Georgian range.  Moved up by 95 (read that Georgian
	is written as though centered between two horizontal lines, rather than
	as sitting on a baseline)  There are still a few very high glyphs.
	
	FontForge U+0122 called Gcommaaccent, glyph looks like that, but
	Unicode says it's Gcedilla.  Made the ones called cedilla by Unicode
	to be cedillas
	
	Note bug in Unicode: standard for 0122, 0123, 0136, 0137, 013B, 013C,
	0145, 0146, 0156, 0157 all talk about cedilla, say to make it with
	cedilla, but example shows comma.
	
	By the way:
	> Got rid of commaaccent and dotlessj in Corporate Use
	> Replaced shadedark, with little squares now not overlapping.
	> Corrected IPA symbol 'ts' 02A6, added 02a8, 02a9, 02aa, 02ab, 02ac,
	  02ad, 02ae, 02af
	
	(so many changes...the CVS server was down...)

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Re-named arabic and hebrew characters
	Big adjustment to comma-accents.  Mostly effects Greek Extended.
	Made such accents to be like comma, rather than like Russian apostrophe
	(and de-referenced that symbol)

2008-04-04 Steve White
	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd:

	Raised dot on superscript i (2071) -- more distinct at small sizes

	* FreeMono.sfd:

	added two IPA symbols

2008-04-02 Steve White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	fixed a few more control points too close

	Fixed names of languages in ligature table for latn "w/i".
	This fixes a crash when FontForge opened the ttf table

	Motivated by bug crashing FontForge when opening ttf file,
	started cleanup of useless control points.  Not finished.
	Got partway through Sinhala

2008-03-31 Steve White

	and bad TT matrices.  (lots more bad TT matrices remain)

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Re-named a bunch of Cyrillic letters

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Tightened spacing on glyphs of last commit

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd:

	Concerning bug  #16120, Include upper case Wynn and upper case Yogh
	Adapted Herman Miller's Thyromanes letters  01F7 021C 021D for Serif
	Drew my own versions for Sans.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Added 04F6,7

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Made more Cyrillic diacritics really combine.
	Made a mark lookup just for Cyrillic diacritics,
	Marked most of the unadorned Cyrillic alphabet.
	
	Still not clear on correct shapes for some of the marks.

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	Tweeks to accents

2008-03-29 Steve White
	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Small adjustments in Cyrillic

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Corrected small palochka
	Made Cyrillic combining hundred-thousands and millions really combine
	Named some combining diacriticals

	* FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	Mostly adjusted horizontal spacing of mono oblique faces

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd, FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	More cleanup of Cyrillic ranges
	
	Completely re-did horizontal spacing of SerifItalic and SerifBoldItalic.
	See bug #17912, poor kerning in Cyrillic oblique...
	https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?17912
	It looked like chaos to me. 
	Only so much can be done: the font is flawed.
	But I think the changes make text readable in these faces.
	
	There were dozens of incorrect glyphs in higher-numbered characters.
	I deleted all those I found.  No glyph is better than a wrong glyph.
	
	Futzt with accents, shooting for consistency and readability.
	
	A maintenance thing: making correct references (acyrillic vs a,
	although they may be the same glyph)  I made a lot of headway, but
	it isn't finished.
	
	Likewise, a large fraction of these are compound characters, which can
	be made with references, resulting in easier maintenance, reduced
	likelihood of errors, and smaller files.  I replaced many.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Cyrillic italic
	Added italic, bolditalic
		0493, 04a7, 04AD
	because their form clearly varies in italic.  But was just guessing...

	* FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Cyrillic italic
	
	Added italic, bolditalic
		0493, 04AD
	because their form clearly varies in italic.
	But was just guessing as to exact form.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Overhaul of Cyrillic
	
	Italic, BoldItalic
		added small yat for bug #22588 (note Times New Roman doesn't use
		alternate form in Italic)
	
	All forms of Serif have big problems in Cyrillic.
	
	The ugliest is in roman.  The letters, even of the Russian alphabet, are
	of inconsistent height (awfully, small 0438 (ii) 0446 (tse))
	and they vary from the height of Latin
	and they vary from the height of italic and bold.
	They are a mish-mash of letters from several fonts, of similar (but not
	quite identical) weight, and similar, (but not quite identical) size.
	
	I think the best solution would be to identify the face that best
	matches Latin, and fill the range with that.  I think this is possible
	because the rarer letters seem to be better: the common letters are the
	ones that are wrong.
	
	For now, I just increased the sized of 0438 and 0446, and 048a, 048b,
	also 0459 (lje) 045A (nje) 0464 (dje)
	
	Other issues

	But note: many ranges, esp. Ethiopic, Japanese, and Indic, have way
	too many points, resulting in lumpiness.

	At this point, FontForge can convert splines to quadratic, auto-hint,
	and auto-instrument without segfault.

	* Makefile, sfd/Makefile, tools/GenerateTrueType:

	Alterations to build process: added a Makefile, and made to work
	on my system.  Now auto-hints before generating TrueType.

	* FreeSans.sfd:

	clean-up of all path issues and points too close

2008-03-18  Steve White
	* FreeSans.sfd:

	Something was causing crashing effects in Windows.  Cleanup of
	problems eventually made it go away.  Now works well.

	Cleaned up many "points too close"

	Cleaned up all ATT problems, of which there were many and various.

	# Incorrectly labelled zero-width joiner used in a ligature

	# Incorrect substitution of dotlessi and dotlessj with i and j was
	  somehow connected with FontForge crash.  Attemts to remove the
	  substitution would damage a 'ccmp' table; subsequent changes would
	  result in FontForge crashing on save, and truncating the sfd file. 
	  Surgically removed with vi.

	# A couple of Indic lookups had incorrect script DFLT; one had 'latn'.

	# Don't understand why there are scripts named
		dev2 bng2 grj2 gur2 when there are already deva beng gurj guru
	  But anyway, lots of 'vatu' 'pres' 'haln' and 'liga' lookups contained
	  characters in the '2' scripts but were lablled only for the 'non-2' 
	  ones.  Added the '2' scripts to all these lookups. Suspect a mistake.

	Note: several of these problems are repeated in other Sans faces.
