Fruktur initially appears to be a playful and powerful black letter type with a warm friendly feeling. 
However its construction is closer to that of an upright italic. 
Fruktur offers some of the feeling of a black letter but with higher legibility and greater utility than is typical of black letter type. 
Fruktur will be most useful from medium to large sizes.
