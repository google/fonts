<p><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Funnel+Sans">Funnel Sans</a> and Funnel Display are modern sans-serif typefaces with both clarity and character, originally developed by NORD ID and Kristian MÃ¶ller for Funnel. The typefaces are inspired by the movement and shapes of data points.</p>
    
<p>In Funnel Display, certain parts of the stems are shifted to further enhance the sense of movement.</p>
