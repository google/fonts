<p>Funnel Sans and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Funnel+Sans"></a>Funnel Display</a> are modern sans-serif typefaces with both clarity and character, originally developed by NORD ID and Kristian MÃ¶ller for Funnel. The typefaces are inspired by the movement and shapes of data points.</p>

<p>Funnel Sans is a functional yet personal sans-serif, featuring both square and circular shapes in its letterforms.</p>
