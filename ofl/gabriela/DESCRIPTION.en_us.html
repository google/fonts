<p>Gabriela is a serif typeface with soft shapes, and special terminal 
forms which are shaped like curls. They connect each letter to create 
attractive word shapes and text blocks with a fine texture. In small 
bodies of text she works well for reading, and in headlines provides 
interesting details to catch the eye.</p>
