 Ga Maamli takes inspiration from painted posters advertising events in Accra, Ghana.
 Ga Maamli is an all caps design in which the lowercase letters are also using a capital letter construction.
 The style of the letters mixes the informal and classical.
 The informal quality comes from the speed with which the letters are written.
 The classical feeling comes from the contrast and brush angle looking somewhat like Roman Rustica.
