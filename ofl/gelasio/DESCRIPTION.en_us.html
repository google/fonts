<p>Gelasio is metrics compatible with Georgia in its Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold Italic weights. </p>

<p>Because of the very robust features found in Gelasio's design it is ideally used at in smaller sizes and for longer texts.</p>

<p>Gelasio feels generally formal and rational but offers an occasional flourish. This is more common in the italics. Gelasio was modeled after an original printed sample of a French Transitional or Reale type belonging to the author. Transitional types are marked by and interest in rational planning. As a result they tend to feature a tension between rigor and expression. This style of type traces its origin to the Romain Du Roi typeface which was introduced in 1702.</p>
