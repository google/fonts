    Gemunu Libre is the Unicode compliant version of the popular Sinhala typeface ‘FM Gemunu’ and includes Latin
    support as well. This font family has been improved in many ways over FM Gemunu during the
    Unicode adaptation process by acquiring more breathing space, bigger counters and smooth uniformity in curves.

    What sets Gemunu Libre apart from all the other Sinhala typefaces currently in use is the distinctive smooth and
    square edge, which was perfected whilst completely redrawing the set of characters in order to cater to the
    requirements of web and screens. Gemunu Libre comes in 7 weights from Extra Light to Extra Bold, and each weight
    contains the complete Sinhala script and a matching Latin characters.
