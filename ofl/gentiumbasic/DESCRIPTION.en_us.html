<p>
The Gentium Basic font family is based on the original Gentium design, but with additional weights. 
The family comes with a complete regular, bold, italic and bold italic set of fonts.
</p>
<p>
The supported character set, however, is much smaller than for the main Gentium Plus fonts. 
These "Basic" fonts support only the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement Unicode ranges, 
plus a selection of the more commonly used extended Latin characters, with miscellaneous diacritical marks, symbols and punctuation. 
Please see the <a href="http://software.sil.org/gentium/">Gentium project homepage</a> for more details on languages supported.

The <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Gentium+Book+Basic">Gentium Book Basic</a> family is very similar but has a slightly darker weight.
