<p>Gentium Plus is the new version of the two reduced character set families, Gentium Basic and Gentium Book Basic. Those 'Basic' families only cover a limited range of Latin, and none of Gentium Plus's Ext Latin, Cyrillic, or Greek (both modern and ancient).</p>

<p>Gentium Plus now extends the same 8 styles/weights of the previous Gentium Basic and to the full character set, packaged as two R B I BI families: Gentium Plus and Gentium Book Plus (also on github).</p> 

<p>This update brings many other improvements, including a very significant improvement in hinting for Windows users and WOFF2 versions. These fonts cover a far greater character set than the Gentium Basic, so are larger, but since GF subsets the difference won't affect users.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Gentium+Book+Plus">Gentium Book Plus</a> family is very similar but has a slightly darker weight.</p>
