 Geologica is grounded in the humanist genre, but leans assertively into geometric, constructed letterforms to find its stability.
 The wide stance, generous spacing, large apertures and even colour makes Geologica a serious text typeface.
 The stylistic “Sharpness” axis adds a rational interpretation of calligraphic pen strokes - a modernist echo of the roots of writing.
