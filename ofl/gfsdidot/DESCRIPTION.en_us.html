GFS Didot is based on the Greek typeface – Didot – a typeface by the famous French typecutter Firmin Didot who designed it under the influence 
of neoclassical ideals of the late 18th century. GFS Didot was designed by Takis Katsoulidis, and digitised by George Matthiopoulos. 
The typeface is accompanied by a matching latin alphabet based on Hermann Zapf’s Palatino.
