GFS Neohellenic is a font style originally designed to fulfill the needs of Classical Studies in the major European universities through 
the 19th and 20th century, up until 1927 when Monotype Corporation was commissioned to develop a Greek type called New Hellenic. 
GFS Neohellenic is a developed form of New Hellenic that echoes the basic form of geometric designs from the 19th century. 
The small serifs are said to make a better reading experience. Suitable for brand identity needs.
