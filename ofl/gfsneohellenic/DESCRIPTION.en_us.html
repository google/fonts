GFS Neohellenic is a font style originally designed to fulfill the needs of Classical Studies in the major European universities through the 19th and 20th century, 
up until 1927 when Monotype Corporation was commissioned to develop a Greek type called New Hellenic. 
GFS Neohellenic is a developed form of New Hellenic that echoes the basic form of geometric designs from the 19th century. 
The inclusion of little serif along the edges help make the text read better. Suitable for brand identity needs
