<p>Gilda Display is a font of classic proportions, in which we can see the
finest treatment of curves, strokes and serifs. The high stroke contrast has
especially smooth transitions, making this type perfect for the world of
fashion, jewelry and luxury items. Gilda Display typically contributes all its
glamor to headlines, but the considered design of this font gives it potential
for use in longer texts with a fine page texture.</p>

<p>Since Junuary 2023, the glyphset is completed and and the font has a bigger language support</p>
