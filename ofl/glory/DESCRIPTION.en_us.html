Glory is a modern sans serif font. The rounded corners give it a soft, contemporary feel. While the characters are slightly condensed, this semi mono-weight sans features subtly curved vertical strokes.  
</p>
<p>
It was created with graphic design in mind. It is suitable for logos, headlines and body text with the available six weights. Combine Glory with other script styles to give your work warmth and contrast. For a truly professional look, team up Glory with its script companion, Hurricane.

Glory comes with Latin Character sets including Western, Central, and Vietnamese language support.
