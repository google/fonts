<p>Goblin One belongs to the category of display types called "Latin". This is
because of its sharp triangular serifs. Goblin One was inspired by a hand
painted sign above a pub in the town of Reading (UK). Goblin One is a somewhat
wide medium contrast design with a large x-height. Goblin One is both
attention-getting and fun. Goblin is suitable for use in medium to large sizes
including headlines. This font was made specifically to be web type.</p>
