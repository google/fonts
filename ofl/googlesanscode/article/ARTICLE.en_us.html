<!-- Section 1: Short description -->
<h3>Introducing Google Sans Code</h3>
<p>
  Google Sans Code is a fixed-width, geometric sans-serif typeface developed to complement Google's
  corporate branding fonts. Derived from our other brand fonts, this typeface has been crafted
  specifically for writing and reading code, and enhanced for clarity at text dimensions typically
  used in programming interfaces.

<!-- Section 2: History and design details -->

<h3>History and design details</h3>
<p>
  The architecture of Google Sans Code merges geometric precision with calligraphic expression
  within the constraints of a fixed-width canvas. The Roman variant builds on a clean, structured
  sans-serif foundation, ensuring optimal readability in code and data-intensive environments. In
  contrast, the Italic variant draws inspiration from early Italian italics, providing a distinctive
  and expressive complementary style. This thoughtful pairing delivers a unique combination of
  technical precision, historical elegance, and personable quirkiness.

<!-- Section 3: Readability & legibility at small sizes -->

<h3>Readability & legibility at small sizes</h3>
<p>
  The fundamental structure of shapes in the Roman design maximizes counter space in letterforms by
  employing gradual curve radii and straight vertical stem segments in predominantly circular
  letters, enhancing clarity at target sizes.

<p>
  Characters with idiosyncratic features like 'a', 'g', and 'Q' incorporate elements from
  traditional text typefaces to improve recognition in situations where conventional sans serif
  forms might be confused with similar characters.

<p>
  Symbols frequently used as lexical elements in programming languages have been refined for
  immediate recognition and to maintain an equal visual balance with alphanumerical components
  within the syntactical hierarchy at intended sizes.

<!-- Section 4: Expressive italics -->

<h3>Expressive italics</h3>
<p>
  The italic style, commonly employed for code comments in syntax highlighting schemes, features a
  more dynamic and contrasting appearance compared to the Roman. This approach parallels Latin
  handwritten manuscripts where authors' annotations appeared in an italic hand, distinguishing them
  from the primary text set in Roman style, establishing a visual hierarchy throughout the document.
</p>
<p>
  The letterforms draw inspiration from Ludovico Vicentino degli Arrighi's pioneering italic
  typefaces.

<!-- Section 5: Auxiliary characters and language support -->

<h3>Auxiliary characters and language support</h3>
<p>
  The character set encompasses support for contemporary programming languages with extensions into
  box-drawing characters and geometric symbols. Google Sans Code also accommodates a comprehensive
  range of human languages that utilize the Latin writing system.
