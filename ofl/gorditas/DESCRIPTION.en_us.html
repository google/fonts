<p>Gorditas is a fun and funky display slab serif typeface family.
Its main features are chunky serifs, and cute hearts replacing the dots in lowercase letters i, j and the fullstop. 
It can be used for coloring books, book covers and childrenâ€™s literature. A great option for creative and fun projects.
