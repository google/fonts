<p>Grand Hotel finds its inspiration from the title screen of the 1937 film
"Cafe Metropole" starring Tyrone Power. This condensed upright connecting
script has a classic vibe to it.</p>

<p>It has a wonderful weight to it that feels subtly tied to Holiday and
Bakery themed designs, even though it can work outside that genre.</p>

<p>Designed by Brian J. Bonislawsky and Jim Lyles for Astigmatic (AOETI).
