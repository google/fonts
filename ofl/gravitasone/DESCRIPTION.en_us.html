<p>Gravitas One is modeled on the "UK fat face" which is a kind of very heavy
advertising type created during the industrial revolution in England. The
letter forms are characterized by an attention-getting and strong contrast
between the very heavy vertical shapes and the thin horizontal ones. The
contrast of the design means that it will be most useful when set from medium
to large sizes.</p>
