<p>Gungsuh is a well-known myeongjo(brush)-style font that first shipped with Windows 95. It is derived from handwritten calligraphy and is more suitable for shorter text strings or display applications than long-form text. This version includes proportional Latin characters. For a version with monospace, half-width Latin characters, see GungsuhChe.</p>
