<p>GungsuhChe is a well-known myeongjo(brush)-style font that first shipped with Windows 95. It is derived from handwritten calligraphy and is more suitable for shorter text strings or display applications than long-form text. This version includes monospace, half-width Latin characters. For a version with proportional Latin characters, see Gungsuh.</p>
