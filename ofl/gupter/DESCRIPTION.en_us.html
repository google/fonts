<p>Gupter is a condensed serif font which takes inspiration from early 20th century English fonts such as Times New Roman.</p>

<p>The family excels in small spaces, due to its large x-height and condensed letterforms. The light stems and subtle details give it a gentle personality and a nice color balance on the page.</p>
