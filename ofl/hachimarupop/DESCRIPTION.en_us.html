HachiMaruPop is a cute font that imaged a circle that was popular among young Japanese girls in the 1970s and 1980s, plus elements of the current round character as well. I think that it is an eye-catching design although it lacks a little on readability, so it is also recommended to use it at large sizes. The name "Hachimaru" is representative of the number "80", like for 1980s. I think that the power to young girls 'Kawaii' such as circle letters, fancy goods and idols was a very strong era.
