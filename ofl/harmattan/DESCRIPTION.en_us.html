<p>Harmattan, named after the trade winds that blow during the winter in West Africa,
  is designed in a Warsh style to suit the needs of languages using the Arabic script in West Africa.</p>

<p>This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using basic connecting
  glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures or contextual alternates
  (only the required lam-alef ligatures.)</p>

<p>Harmattan Version 2.000 (released in June 2020) now includes a Bold style and contains near
  complete coverage of all the characters defined in Unicode 13.0 for Arabic script
  (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks, which are not recommended for normal use).
  It has full support for the Arabic and Arabic Supplement Unicode blocks, and the Arabic Extended-A
  block with the exception of U+08D3..U+08E2.</p>
