 Hedvig is a digital insurance company that is challenging the traditional insurance industry by providing a predictable insurance experience.
</p>
<p>
 The Hedvig typeface family was created by Kanon Foundry in collaboration with Hedvig’s in-house design department.
 The typface reflects Hedvig’s brand philosophy “Stuff happens” – embracing all the things that happen in life, without worry or fear.
</p>
<p>
 The typeface family Hedvig Letters consists of two fonts:
 <br/>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hedvig+Letters+Serif">
    Hedvig Letters Serif
   </a>
   is designed to balance punchy and honest copy with responsibility and comfort.
  </li>
  <li>
   Hedvig Letters Sans takes the role of the work-horse typeface in Hedvig’s visual toolbox.
  </li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p>
 The concept for the typeface was developed by approaching a “non-type-designer” point of view.
 Optical corrections are usually applied to a typeface to fool the eye that certain shapes are balanced or aligned, when in reality they are not.
 For this typeface, the imperfections were embraced instead of corrected.
 The result is a typeface where some letters have a slightly odd, yet characteristic look that effectively communicates Hedvig’s brand and design philosophy.
