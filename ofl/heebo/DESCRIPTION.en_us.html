Heebo is a Hebrew and Latin typeface family, which extends Christian Roberton's Roboto Latin to Hebrew.
The Hebrew was drawn by Oded Ezer and the font files were mastered by Meir Sadan.

<p>
Since the Hebrew design of this family is primary, the vertical metrics are different to the original Roboto family. 
This family is auto-hinted, whereas Roboto is hand-hinted, so the rendering quality of Roboto may be better on older Windows machines.

<p>
In May 2020, the family has been updated to a variable font family.

The Heebo project is led by Meir Sadan, a type designer based in Tel Aviv, Israel.
