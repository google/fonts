<p>Henny Penny is an offbeat display font with loads of personality. Named in honour of the folktale character chicken in Henny Penny. 
 It is a friendly and playful decorative typeface. Its classical nature is successfully hidden behind its very informal structure: 
 There is no common baseline, no common character size and no common slope of the letters. This makes the typeface very amusing. 
 HennyPenny is a headline typeface for use in large size fonts. It may be used for children's books, magazines and websites.</p>
