Hind is an Open Source typeface supporting the Devanagari and Latin scripts. 
Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, which is paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. 
It features vertical stress and open apertures, increasing its legibility and providing optimal quality. 
The entire typeface family feels very legible when used to set text.

<p>
Each font in the Hind family has 1146 glyphs, which include hundreds of unique Devanagari conjuncts. 
These ensure full support for the major languages written with the Devanagari script. 
The Latin component’s character set is a basic western one, which enables typesetting in English and the other Western European languages. 
Hind is a solid choice for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding.
