Hind Colombo, named after Colombo, the capital city of Sri Lanka, is a family of five Sinhala fonts, 
which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. 
In addition to Sinhala, the Hind Colombo fonts also include Latin-script characters.

<p>
Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind Colombo’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. 
It features either a horizontal or vertical stress, and open apertures, increasing its legibility and providing optimal quality.  
</p>
<p>
Hind Colombo is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding.
