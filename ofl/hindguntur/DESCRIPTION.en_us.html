Hind Guntur, a type named after Guntur, a city where Telugu is used, is a family of five Telugu fonts, 
which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. 
In addition to Telugu, the Hind Guntur fonts also include Latin-script characters.

Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. 
It features either a horizontal or vertical stress, and open apertures, increasing its legibility and providing optimal quality. 
Hind Guntur is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding.
