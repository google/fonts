Hind Jalandhar, a type named after Jalandhar, a city in Punjab, India, is a family of five Gurmukhi fonts, 
which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. 
Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind Jalandhar’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, 
paired with seemingly monolinear strokes (quite a common feature in Gurmukhi typefaces).

It features either a horizontal or vertical stress and open apertures, increasing its legibility and providing optimal quality. 
Each font in the family has 475 glyphs, which includes all of the characters needed to write the Punjabi languages. 
Hind Jalandhar is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding.
