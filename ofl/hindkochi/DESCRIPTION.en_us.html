Hind Kochi, named after Kochi, a city in Kerala, India - is a family of five Malayalam fonts, 
which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. 
In addition to Malayalam, the Hind Kochi fonts also include Latin-script characters.

Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, 
paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. 
It features either a horizontal or vertical stress, and open apertures, increasing its legibility and providing optimal quality. 
Hind Kochi’s Malayalam and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that multi-script texts will sit nicely 
alongside each other. 
There are specific design features added to Hind Kochi’s Malayalam features that give text set in that language a nice, 
fresh feeling, with a very modern appearance.

<p>
Each font in the Hind Kochi family has 530 glyphs, which includes all of the characters needed to write Malayalam. 
The Latin character set is Adobe Latin 3, enabling typesetting for English and other Western European languages. 
Hind Kochi is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding. 
Dhruvi Tolia designed Hind Kochi for ITF, who first published the fonts in 2015.
