# Investigation Report: Hind Kochi

## Summary

Hind Kochi is a Malayalam typeface designed by Dhruvi Tolia for Indian Type Foundry (ITF), part of the Hind Multi-Script project. It was onboarded to Google Fonts on September 14, 2015 by Dave Crossland. The upstream repository at `https://github.com/itfoundry/hind-kochi` is confirmed and cached. The repository uses a custom `hindkit` build system (not gftools-builder) and has no `config.yaml`. An override `config.yaml` referencing `masters/HindKochi.glyphs` already exists in the google/fonts family directory. The source block in METADATA.pb has a `repository_url` but is missing a `commit` hash. The recommended commit hash is `57ad679` (Compile 1.000, the HEAD and final commit in the repo).

## Investigation Details

### METADATA.pb Analysis

The current METADATA.pb contains:
- `name: "Hind Kochi"`
- `designer: "Indian Type Foundry"`
- `date_added: "2016-01-20"`
- `source { repository_url: "https://github.com/itfoundry/hind-kochi" }`
- Missing: `commit` hash in source block
- Missing: `config_yaml` in source block (not needed since override config.yaml exists locally)

The `repository_url` was added by Simon Cozens in commit 474a446c0 ("More upstreams (g,h)", Jan 14, 2024).

### Google Fonts Git History

1. **8fe6e7c51** (Sep 14, 2015) - "Adding Hind Kochi" by Dave Crossland. Initial onboarding with 5 TTF files (62-63 KB each), DESCRIPTION.en_us.html, METADATA.json, and OFL.txt.
2. **e44e0e005** - date_added updates for ofl/hind* families.
3. **474a446c0** (Jan 14, 2024) - Added `repository_url` to source block.
4. **5ddf312e6** (Feb 20, 2026) - Added override config.yaml referencing `masters/HindKochi.glyphs`.

The TTF binary files have never been updated since the initial onboarding on Sep 14, 2015.

### Upstream Repository Analysis

- **Repository**: https://github.com/itfoundry/hind-kochi
- **Cached at**: upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/itfoundry/hind-kochi
- **Status**: Clean, up-to-date with origin/master
- **Single branch**: master
- **No tags**
- **Total commits**: 21

#### Commit Timeline

The repository has a linear history (with one merge) from July 2015 to October 2015:
- First commit: 8a88f4c (Jul 3, 2015) - "Initial commit"
- Last compile before onboarding: 90da2d1 (Aug 28, 2015) - "Compile 0.702; close #1, #2"
- Post-onboarding source changes: 2cf4ae8 (Oct 16, 2015) - "Remove glyphs already in Hind.glyphs"
- Final commit (HEAD): 57ad679 (Oct 17, 2015) - "Compile 1.000"

The repository has been completely static since October 17, 2015 (~10 years).

### Onboarding Commit Determination

The google/fonts initial addition was Sep 14, 2015. The latest upstream compile before that date was v0.702 (Aug 28, 2015, commit 90da2d1). The "Compile 1.000" commit (57ad679, Oct 17, 2015) came after the onboarding, meaning the fonts currently in google/fonts are likely v0.702 or were built from a pre-1.000 source state.

However, since:
1. The repo has been completely static for ~10 years
2. 57ad679 is the HEAD/master commit
3. The "Compile 1.000" represents the final, most complete state of the sources
4. The fonts in google/fonts were never updated to v1.000 either

Using 57ad679 (HEAD) as the reference commit is the pragmatic choice, as it represents the canonical final state of the upstream sources. The actual fonts served by Google Fonts may be from an earlier build, but the sources at HEAD are the authoritative version.

**Confidence: MEDIUM** - The HEAD commit is after the onboarding date, but it's the only meaningful reference point since the repo is dormant.

### Build System

The repository uses a custom `hindkit` build system (`build.py`), not gftools-builder. The build.py script:
- Imports `hindkit` (https://github.com/itfoundry/hindkit)
- Generates OTF files (not TTF) in the `build/` directory
- Sets fontrevision to "1.000"
- Uses `makeinstances`, `checkoutlines`, and style linking options

The TTF files in google/fonts were likely generated by the onboarder (Dave Crossland) using a separate TTF generation process.

### Source Files

- **masters/HindKochi.glyphs** - Glyphs source file (658 KB)
- The .glyphs file was last modified in commit 2cf4ae8 (Oct 16, 2015) - "Remove glyphs already in Hind.glyphs"
- This is a gftools-builder compatible source format

### Override Config

An override `config.yaml` exists in google/fonts at `ofl/hindkochi/config.yaml`:
```yaml
sources:
  - masters/HindKochi.glyphs
```
This was added in commit 5ddf312e6 (Feb 20, 2026). Since the override exists locally, `config_yaml` does not need to be set in METADATA.pb.

## Conclusion

Hind Kochi has a confirmed upstream repository with gftools-builder compatible sources (.glyphs file). The source block needs a `commit` hash added. The recommended commit is 57ad679 (HEAD of master, "Compile 1.000"). An override config.yaml already exists in the google/fonts directory. The METADATA.pb source block should be enriched with the commit hash.

**Status: missing_config** -- The override config.yaml exists, but the commit hash is still missing from the METADATA.pb source block. Once the commit hash is added, status will be complete.
