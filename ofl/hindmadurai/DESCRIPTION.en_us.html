Hind Madurai, a type named after Madurai, a city in Tamil Nadu of India, is a family of five Tamil fonts, 
which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. 
In addition to Tamil, the Hind Madurai fonts also include Latin-script characters.

Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. 
It features either a horizontal or vertical stress, and open apertures, increasing its legibility and providing optimal quality. 
Although Hind Madurai is a “monolinear sans” face, much of its design features tends toward the traditional end of the design spectrum. 
Each font in the Hind Madurai family has 552 glyphs, which includes all of the characters needed to write Tamil.

Hind Madurai is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding. 
Jyotish Sonowal designed Hind Madurai for ITF, who first published the fonts in 2015.
