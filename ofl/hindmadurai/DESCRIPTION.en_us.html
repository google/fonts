Hind Madurai, a type named after Madurai, a city in Tamil Nadu of India, is a family of five Tamil fonts, 
which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. 
In addition to Tamil, the Hind Madurai fonts also include Latin-script characters.

Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. 
It features either a horizontal or vertical stress, and open apertures, increasing its legibility and providing optimal quality. 
Although Hind Madurai is a “monolinear sans” face, much of its design features tends toward the traditional end of the design spectrum.

<p>
Each font in the Hind Madurai family has 552 glyphs, which includes all of the characters needed to write Tamil. 
Hind Madurai is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding.
Jyotish Sonowal designed Hind Madurai for ITF, who first published the fonts in 2015.
