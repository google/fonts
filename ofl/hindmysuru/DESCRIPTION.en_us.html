Hind Mysuru, named after Mysuru, a city in Karnataka, India - is a family of five Kannada fonts, 
which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. 
In addition to Kannada, the Hind Mysuru fonts also include Latin-script characters.

Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, 
paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. 
It features either a horizontal or vertical stress, and open apertures, increasing its legibility and providing optimal quality. 
Hind Mysuru’s Kannada and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that multi-script texts will sits nicely 
alongside each other.

Aside from the Latin glyphs, each of the five Hind Mysuru fonts has 444 Kannada glyphs, including many unique conjuncts. 
These ensure full support for the writing of the Kannada language. 
The Latin script’s character set is Adobe Latin 3, enabling the typesetting of English and other Western European languages.

Hind Mysuru is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding. 
Manushi Parikh designed Hind Mysuru for ITF, who first published the fonts in 2015.
