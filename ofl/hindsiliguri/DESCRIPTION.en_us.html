Hind Siliguri, a type named after Siliguri, a city in West Bengal of India, is a family of five Bengali fonts, 
which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. 
In addition to Bengali, the Hind Siliguri fonts also include Latin-script characters.

Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, 
paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. It features either a horizontal or vertical stress, and open apertures, 
increasing its legibility and providing optimal quality. 
The Bengali and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that the Bengali headline is more or less at the same visual height 
as the Latin capital letters share.

Each font in the Hind Siliguri family has 820 glyphs, including many unique Bengali conjuncts. 
Hind Siliguri is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding. 
Jyotish Sonowal designed Hind Siliguri for ITF, who first published the fonts in 2015.
