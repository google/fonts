Hind Vadodara, a type named after Vadodara, a city in Gujarat of India, is a family of five Gujarati fonts, 
which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. 
In addition to Gujarati, the Hind Vadodara fonts also include Latin-script characters.

Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, 
paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. It features either a horizontal or vertical stress, and open apertures, 
increasing its legibility and providing optimal quality. The Gujarati and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other 
so that the height of the Gujarati base characters is more or less at the same visual height that the Latin capital letters share. 
Each font in the Hind Vadodara family has 851 glyphs, which include many unique Gujarati conjuncts.

Hind Vadodara is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding. 
Hitesh Malaviya designed Hind Vadodara for ITF, who first published the fonts in 2015.
