<p>Homenaje is inspired by the bronze cemetery art found in the Recoleta and
Chacaritas districts of Buenos Aires, Argentina. A grotesque and narrow type,
it provides economy in text setting without losing its strong, straight and
steady features. The name “Homenaje” means tribute in Spanish, a modest way to
honor the patient and accurate work of the lettering artists whose bronze
letters honor a lifetime.</p>
