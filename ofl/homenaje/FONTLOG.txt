FONTLOG for Homenaje font

This file provides detailed information on the Homenaje 
font software.

This information should be distributed along with the Homenaje 
font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Homenaje is inspired by the bronze cemetery art found in 
the Recoleta and Chacaritas districts of Buenos Aires, 
Argentina. A grotesque and narrow type, it provides 
economy in text setting without losing its strong, straight and 
steady features. The name “Homenaje” means tribute in Spanish, 
a modest way to honor the patient and accurate work of 
the lettering artists whose bronze letters honor a lifetime.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1
