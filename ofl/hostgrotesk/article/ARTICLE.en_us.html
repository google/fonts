    As a uniwidth typeface, Host Grotesk facilitates smooth transitions between font weights without disrupting the overall design coherence and layouts. For instance, a button's size remains constant even when the font-weight increases in a hover state. Similarly, making a part of a sentence bolder doesn't push the letters to the next row.

    Calibrated for display and text applications, the low contrast stroke modulation and closed terminals complement the simple construction of letterforms, making it an obvious choice for the digital medium. Proportions sit between a generous geometric sans and a compact grotesque, allowing usage in display sizes and small body copy.

    The Host Grotesk family is built on Jonny Pinhorn's beloved Poppins. While most letters are reworked and modified for the new look and duplexed proportions, Poppins' soft and approachable essence remains visible. A reliable and cohesive type family for user interfaces, branding, and communication materials, combining the contemporary workhorse category with the elevated functionality of uniwidth proportions.
