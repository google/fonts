<p>Hubot Sans is Mona Sans’s robotic sidekick. The typeface is designed with more geometric accents to lend a technical and idiosyncratic feel—perfect for headers and pull-quotes. Made together with Degarism.</p>

<p>Hubot Sans is a variable font. Variable fonts enable different variations of a typeface to be incorporated into one single file, and are supported by all major browsers.</p>
