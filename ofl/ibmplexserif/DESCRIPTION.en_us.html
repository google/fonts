    IBM Plex® is the corporate typeface for IBM worldwide and an open-source project developed by the IBM Brand &amp;
    Experience team (BX&amp;D). Plex is an international typeface family designed to capture IBM&rsquo;s brand spirit
    and history and to illustrate the unique relationship between mankind and machine—a principal theme for IBM since
    the turn of the century. The result is a neutral yet friendly Grotesque style typeface that balances design with the
    engineered details that make Plex distinctly IBM. <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=ibm+plex"></a>The
    family</a> includes a Sans, Sans Condensed, Mono, and Serif and has excellent legibility in print, web, and mobile
    interfaces.

    Plex&rsquo;s three designs work well independently and even better together. Use the Sans as a
    contemporary compadre, the Serif for editorial storytelling, or the Mono to show code snippets. The unexpectedly
    expressive nature of the italics gives you even more options for your designs. Currently, IBM Plex Sans supports
    Extended Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean and Thai.
