IM Fell Great Primer SC (small caps) is one family within a revival project of all the Fell Types – a collection of types bequeathed by John Fell to the University of Oxford in 1686, who was Bishop of Oxford and Dean of Christ Church.
The fonts are all characterized by an unrefined look, where letterforms are intentionally uneven, which can be attributed to the strong fidelity of this particular revival process.

All the typefaces are useful today for websites, books, essays, magazines and advertisements, and they come in different variations designed for different sizes of use. 
IM Fell Great Primer SC is intended to be used at 17 points, suitable for subheadings.
