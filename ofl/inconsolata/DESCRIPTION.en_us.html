Inconsolata is a good demonstration of monospaced fonts that do not suck. 
The characters are evenly spaced out, allowing for comfortable on-screen reading. 
It has a typewriter feel to it which makes it ideal for both personal and business correspondence.

The development of the Regular style by Raph Levien was started in 2006 using his own Spiro-based tools and FontForge.
The Bold style was designed by Kirill Tkachev and the Cyreal foundry in 2012.
