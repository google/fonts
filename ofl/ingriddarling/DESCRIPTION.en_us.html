Ingrid Darling is a cute script font originally created for greeting cards. It is based on a cursive hand writing style that has a playful, whimsical appeal. It would be best served as a display font and should be used sparingly rather than in larger bodies of type.

It comes with Latin Character sets including Western, Central, and Vietnamese language support.
