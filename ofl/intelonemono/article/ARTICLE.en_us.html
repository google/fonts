    Introducing Intel One Mono, an expressive monospaced font family that’s built with clarity, legibility, and the
    needs of developers in mind.
</p>
<p>
    Identifying the typographically underserved low-vision developer audience, Frere-Jones Type designed the Intel One
    Mono typeface in partnership with the Intel Brand Team and VMLY&amp;R, for maximum legibility to address developers'
    fatigue and eyestrain and reduce coding errors. A panel of low-vision and legally blind developers provided feedback
    at each stage of design.
</p>
<p>
    Intel One Mono also covers a wide range of over 200 languages using the Latin script. The Intel One Mono fonts are
    provided in four weights — Light, Regular, Medium, and Bold — with matching italics, and we are happy to share both
    an official release of fonts ready to use as well as editable sources.
