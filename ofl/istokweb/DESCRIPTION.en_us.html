Istok Web is an original typeface, in development since 2008. In the early stages,
some basic letters were based on specially modified METAFONT sources from the CM
Bright font family from the TeX community. (METAFONT is very flexible
technology.) But Istok fonts are now very far from this origin.
Contours of the font are designed in the freely distributable font editor, 
<a href="http://fontforge.sourceforge.net">FontForge</a>.</p>

<p>Most glyphs are manually hinted with the aim to be rendered on LCD
displays. I used <a href="http://xgridfit.sourceforge.net">xgridfit</a> as a
tool for programming truetype instructions. Less frequently utilized symbols
have automatic instructions produced by FontForge autohinting, until manual
hinting can be done. Manual and automatic instructions are intended to look
homogeneous.</p>

<p>The original sources and truetype fonts are available at 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/istok/">code.google.com/p/istok</a> and 
this 'Web' version has modified vertical metrics.</p>
