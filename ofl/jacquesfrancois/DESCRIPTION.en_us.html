<p>Jacques Francois is a revival of the c. 1760 Enschedé no. 811 type specimen by Jacques
François Rosart (1714-1774), made for Enschedé Printing House. 
It was designed to give an even typographic color while preserving the essential historic peculiarities 
of the original. It has an expanded glyph set, and to improve readability on the web, the x-height is increased and 
the thinnest parts of letterforms are sturdier.</p>

<p>Jacques Francois is designed for medium to small size usage. Old style figures are included.</p>

<p>There is also <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Jacques+Francois+Shadow">Jacques
Francois Shadow</a>, an incised variant.</p>

<p>Jacques Francois was designed by Manvel Shmavonyan and Alexei Vanyashin.
