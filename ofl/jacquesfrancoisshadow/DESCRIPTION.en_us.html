<p>Jacques Francois is a revival of the c. 1760 Enschedé no. 811 type specimen by Jacques
François Rosart (1714-1774), made for Enschedé Printing House. 
It was designed to give an even typographic color while preserving the essential historic peculiarities 
of the original. It has an expanded glyph set, and to improve readability on the web, the x-height is increased and 
the thinnest parts of letterforms are sturdier.</p>

<p>Jacques Francois Shadow is designed for large sizes and manually instructed
for better screen performance starting from 24 ppem. This means that on Window
machines it will work best from 18pt (at 96ppi) or 15pt (at 120ppi) and from
24pt on Mac (at 72ppi.)</p>

<p>There is also <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Jacques+Francois">Jacques
Francois</a>, a text variant.</p>

<p>Jacques Francois Shadow was designed by Manvel Shmavonyan and Alexei Vanyashin.
