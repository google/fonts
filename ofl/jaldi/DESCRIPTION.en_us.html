Jaldi is the Hindi word for soon, and the typeface family is a contemporary sans-serif Devanagari with subtle rounded corners. 
Designed by Nicolas Silva and Pablo Cosgaya, Jaldi is developed to match with the Latin design of the <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Asap">Asap family</a>, named after the acronym "As Soon As Possible."
</p>

<p>
This family is specially developed for screen reading and use as a webfont, and like Asap, it is has a special twist: 
Jaldi offers a standardised character width on all styles, which means that lines of text always remain the same length.
This useful feature allows users to change type styles on-the-go without reflowing text bodies.

<p>
Asap is based on Ancha, designed by Pablo Cosgaya and Hector Gatti in collaboration with Andres Torresi.
This project is led by Omnibus Type, a type foundry based in Argentina.
