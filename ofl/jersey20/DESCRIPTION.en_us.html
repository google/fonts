<p>The Soft Type Collection is designed for knitters to chart out their typographic projects. Jersey is a sporty, versitile sans-serif typeface, knittable at various sizes.</p>

<p>Each typeface has a “Regular” and “Charted” version, and some include multiple scales so you can fit type on your knits, no matter the project's size. Check out the charted version <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jersey+20+Charted">Jersey 20 Charted</a>.</p>

<p>In this collection, the number following the typeface's name indicates the height of the capital letters for that typeface.</p>
