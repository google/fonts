<p>The Soft Type Collection is designed for knitters to chart out their typographic projects. Jersey is a sporty, versatile sans-serif typeface, knittable in various sizes.</p>

<p>Each typeface has a “Regular” and “Charted” version, and some include multiple scales so you can fit type on your knits, no matter the project's size. Check out the non-charted version <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jersey+25">Jersey 25</a>.</p>

<p>In this collection, the number following the typeface's name indicates the height of the capital letters for that typeface. For this particular style, it's best to use a minimum of 30pt font size to ensure that it's clear, legible, and visually appealing across different platforms and mediums.</p>
