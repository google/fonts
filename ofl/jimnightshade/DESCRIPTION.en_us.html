<p>Jim Nightshade is one of those calligraphic pen styles that have a mysterious and almost dark vibe to them.</p> 
<p>Named after a character from the story, "Something Wicked This Way Comes", Jim Nightshade is a flat nib calligraphic typestyle with 
charisma and a dark flair. Letterforms follow that of a traditional italic hand, but with more angular strokes to accentuate the look.</p>
