The idea of this typeface is to be geometric, elegant, with a vintage feeling, for use at larger sizes.
It is inspired by geometric sans serif designs from the 1920s.
The x-height is half way from baseline to cap height, an unusual proportion.
Josefin has a picturesque quality which makes it suitable for captions, headlines, billboards and street signage.
