The idea for creating this typeface was to make it geometric, elegant and kind of vintage, especially for titling. 
It is based on Rudolf Koch's Kabel (1927), Rudolf Wolf's Memphis (1930),Paul Renner's Futura (1927?).

The idea was to draw something with good style, that reflects Swedish design and their passion for a good lifestyle, 
and by default all other Scandinavian styles.

The x-height is half way from baseline to caps height, unlike any other modern typeface.

Wanting to do something different with the ampersand, the designer made three and will include them as alternates in future versions. 
This version also includes Old Style Numerals.
