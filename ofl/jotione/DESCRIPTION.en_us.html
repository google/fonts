Joti One was inspired by Eduardo Tunni’s little son – Jonah, who is called "Joti"  by his friends. 
The type has the informality and style of cartoons children love to watch. 
Its primary concept is top-heavy stems with a slight sense of movement to further enhance the style. 
Joti is ideal for composing headlines and short texts in sizes larger than 14 points.
