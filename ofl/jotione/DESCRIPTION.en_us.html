<p>I enjoyed designing this typeface because it was inspired by my little son
"Jonah," who is called by his friends "Joti." The type has the informality and
style of the cartoons which children watch. Its primary concept is top-heavy
stems with a slight sense of movement to further enhance the style. Joti is
ideal for composing headlines and short texts in sizes larger than 14
points.</p>
