<p>The peculiarity of this typography lies in its curved structures and strokes, which are developed on it by getting thinner and sharper as if they were being typed using a metallic and bevel-edged point.</p> <p>The visual mark characteristic of Julee is a casual cursive-like type, yet balanced due to the tidy proportions of its signs.</p>
