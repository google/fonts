Jura Font
===============================
This file provides detailed information on the Jura font family.
This information should be distributed along with the Jura fonts and
any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
----------------------

Jura was designed by Daniel Johnson.  Please send any bug reports or glyph
requests to il.basso.buffo@gmail.com.

Jura is available in four weights: Book, Medium, DemiBold, and Bold.

The Jura family has an unfortunate name clash with Ed Merritt's Jura serif font,
which may be found at http://www.tenbytwenty.com/products/typefaces/jura.

In July 2016 Alexei Vanyashin completed a full redesign of the font as part
of the Font Improvements project. 

Licensing
----------------------

The Jura fonts are licensed under the Open Font License. As of version 2.5 of
this font family, there is no longer a Reserved Name clause for the Jura fonts,
enabling the free conversion between font formats.

The glyphs in the Kayah Li range (U+A900 - U+A92F) are dual-licensed under the
Open Font License and the GNU Public License, version 3, with the Font
Exception. These glyphs are also included in FreeMono, which is part of
the GNU FreeFont project (http://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/), as of the
20100919 release.

You should have received a copy of both these licenses bundled with the font.
