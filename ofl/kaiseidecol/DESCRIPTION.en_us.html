Kaisei Decol is designed with the same element in Kanji, the little dot at the end of the stroke. When typesetted, because of this dot elements, it makes less stimulus to eyes and also gives a cute and fun impression. Best suited for a short sentence, preferably title. Good to use together with Kaisei Opti.
