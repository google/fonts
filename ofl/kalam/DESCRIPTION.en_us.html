Kalam is a handwriting font family that supports the Devanagari and Latin writing systems. 
Even though Kalam's letterforms derive from handwriting, the fonts have each been optimized for on-screen usage. 
Kalam's letterforms feature a very steep slant from the top right to the bottom left. 
They are similar to letters used in everyday handwriting, and look like they might have been written with either a thin felt-tip pen, or a ball-point pen.

The typeface is a design that feels very personal. 
Like many informal handwriting-style fonts, it appears rather fresh and new when seen on screen or printed on the page. 
Lipi Raval and Jonny Pinhorn developed the family for ITF; 
Raval designed the Devanagari component while she and Pinhorn worked together on the Latin.
