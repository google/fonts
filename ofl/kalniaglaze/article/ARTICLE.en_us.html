COLRv1 is the latest version of the color font format combining transparency, gradients, and variable font technology. As one of the advantages of the format, it's possible to change the color palettes in code. CSS offers easy and powerful customization options using the "override-colors" property. Kalnia Glaze also has four main icons with the option of using them solo or with a frame.

Kalnia Glaze is the result of an broad exploration of the latest COLRv1 format and it's integration with the variable font technology. The objective was not only to create a complex layered design to explore the possibilities of the format but also to streamline and expedite the process, minimizing the need for manual adjustments through software and emphasizing the automation of processes using paintcompiler, a program by Simon Cozens.
