<p>Kantumruy Pro is a newly redrawn design of the first Kantumruy (published in 2013) which is a modern display Khmer typeface that is being used by small and big brands in Cambodia, as well as many non-profit organizations for their visual identities. In the new version, the design direction mostly remains the same, however, there are major changes in vertical metrics and proportions, some letterforms, and the Italic set is also included. The Latin set in Kantumruy Pro is from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans">Work Sans</a>, with modified width and weight.</p>
