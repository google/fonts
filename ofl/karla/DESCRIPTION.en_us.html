Karla is a grotesque sans serif family designed for the Latin and Tamil scripts.
</p>
<p>
This is the Latin part of the family, which has been expanded now to a variable font with a weight axis ranging from ExtraLight to ExtraBold plus full support of Western, Central, and South-Eastern European languages.
</p>
<p>
The Tamil parts are available from the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/earlyaccess" target="_blank">Early Access</a> page.
