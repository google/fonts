<p>Kdam Thmor Two is a revised design of "Kdam Thmor" which is one of Sovichet Tep's typefaces designed and published back in 2013 on Google Fonts.</p>

<p>Kdam Thmor Two is a modern display Khmer typeface based on the writing style of a brush used on a wall. It has an edgy style, a medium size and is suitable for headings and large typography. In this new version, Gemunu Libre's Latin is used as the Latin counterpart in the project.</p>

<p>This update is made possible with the funding from Google Fonts.</p>
