Inspired by her travel and stay in Kenya, Julia Petretta filled her days with sketches and lettering. 
The result was Kenia - a stencil display font. 
With its small point sizes resembling an old German gothic font, Kenia works for headlines, introductory paragraphs, 
and in small text setting. 
Its playful and friendly character makes it suitable for happy typography in magazines, blogs, online games and 
other on-screen and print-based text.
