Khand is a family of compact mono-linear fonts with very open counter forms. 
Developed for display typography, it is primarily intended for headline usage. 
Its letterforms are dynamic, and everything is designed according to a modular system.

<p>
All of its shapes bear a strong commonality to one another, but the typeface strikes a good balancing act and avoids too much repetitiveness. 
The lighter styles are suitable for short paragraphs of running text, while the heavier styles have been optimized for headlines or single word settings.

Khandâ€™s Devanagari component was designed by Sanchit Sawaria and Jyotish Sonowal. 
The Latin component was designed by Satya Rajpurohit.
