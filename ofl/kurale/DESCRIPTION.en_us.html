Kurale is a Latin, Cyrillic and Devanagari typeface derived from 
<a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Gabriela">Gabriela</a>.
The Latin and Cyrillic is a serif typeface with soft shapes, and special terminal forms which are shaped like curls. 
They connect each letter to create attractive word shapes and text blocks with a fine texture. 
The Devanagari is a modulated design that harmonises with the Latin original.
In small bodies of text she works well for reading, and in headlines provides interesting details to catch the eye.
