<p>Labrada is a typeface family designed by Mercedes JÃ¡uregui that expresses the communicative richness of the conversations and discourses of the indigenous cultures of oral tradition, at the same time that it dialogues with the classic forms to function in immersive reading texts. This project began in the Master of Typeface Design, MT-UBA, at the Universidad of Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>
