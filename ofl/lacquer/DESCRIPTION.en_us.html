Lacquer is an expressive display font featuring heavy drips and dozens of alternate glyphs. Lacquer was hand drawn using a paint pen by <a href="https://www.nikipolyocan.com/">Niki Polyocan</a> and was extrapolated and finished by <a href="https://eli-block.com/">Eli Block</a> at Google Creative Lab. You can see all of Lacquer’s glyphs on the font’s <a href="http://lacquer.eli-block.com/">web specimen</a>.
