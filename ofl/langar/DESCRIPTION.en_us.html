<p>Langar is a one-weight Latin/Gurmukhi display font based on informal, playful letterforms. It broadly follows the
    ‘upright-italic’ style of Latin fonts, experimenting with and introducing a similar style for the Gurmukhi script.
</p>
<p>Langar’s harmonised Latin/Gurmukhi design aims to expand the possibilities for both the general user and the
    specialised designer working with bilingual texts by providing a good quality display option. </p>
<p>The design specifically caters to characterful display at larger sizes, providing a contrasting secondary style to
    most text typefaces generally available for Latin/Gurmukhi texts.</p>
