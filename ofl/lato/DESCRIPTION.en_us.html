Lato means summer in Polish, and if it had a middle name it would be – Sleek. 
It was birthed out of a desire to create a typeface that would seem quite “transparent” when used in body text but would display some original traits when used in larger sizes.

Designer Lukasz used classical proportions to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. 
The semi-rounded details of the letters give it a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness – giving it a firm balance between angular and soft. 
Lato personifies thoroughness, readability and balance.
