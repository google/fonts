One of the first fonts to use ornately embellished capital forms, Lavishly Yours is a charming calligraphic script. Its nearly upright style along with looped lowercase miniscules gives this font a fairly tale look.

It comes with Latin Character sets including Western, Central, and Vietnamese language support.
