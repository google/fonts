	By Caroline Hadilaksono, Micah Rich, & Tyler Finck, Mirko Velimirovic. League Gothic is a revival of an old classic, and one of our favorite typefaces, Alternate Gothic &#x23;1. It was originally designed by Morris Fuller Bentonfor the American Type Founders Company in 1903.

	We decided to make our own version, and contribute it to the Open Source Type Movement. Thanks to a commission from the fine & patient folks over at WND.com, itâ€™s been revised & updated with contributions from Micah Rich, Tyler Finck, Dannci and Mirko Velimirovic who contributed extra glyphs. If you would like to contribute to the project please see <a>href="https://github.com/sursly/league-gothic">github.com/sursly/league-gothic</a>
