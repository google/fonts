Riccardo Lorusso, Sabrina Campagna, Elisa Ansuini, Mariangela Di Pinto, Antonio Cavedoni, Marco Comastri, Luna Castroni, Stefano Faoro, 
Daniele Capo, and Jan Henrik Arnold.

This typeface was designed in 8 hours, and was inspired by some of the typefaces used on the Olivetti typewriters.

<p>
The glyphs are 'trispaced.' 
It means that the space are modular, 250, 500, 750, this allow a better spacing between characters, 
but allow also a vertical alignment similar to the one possible with a monospaced font. 
We were thinking it was a bright new idea, but we discovered that was usual for Olivetti typewriters working with 'Margherita.'

Updated in November 2012: As one of the earlier families published in Google Web Fonts, Lekton lacked proper subsetting, 
so this update introduces a default 'latin' subset that contains less characters but loads faster. 
<strong>To use the full character set, update your API link to include the <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started#Subsets">latin-ext subset</a>.</strong>
