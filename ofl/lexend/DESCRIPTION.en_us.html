Lexend fonts are intended to reduce visual stress and so improve reading performance.
Initially they were designed with dyslexia and struggling readers in mind, but Bonnie Shaver-Troup, creator of the Lexend project, soon found out that these fonts are also great for everyone else.

The first set of Lexend fonts by Thomas Jockin
(<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Deca">Deca</a>, 
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Exa">Exa</a>, 
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Giga">Giga</a>, 
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Mega">Mega</a>, 
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Peta">Peta</a>, 
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Tera">Tera</a>, 
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Zetta">Zetta</a>)
all have a 'Medium' weight, and each becomes wider and more openly spaced (also known as "tracked out").
This new version of Lexend Deca is expanded by Font Bureau with a range of 8 weights.

True to Bonnieâ€™s vision, Lexend fonts are freely available for all since 2019 in Google Fonts.
