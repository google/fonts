<p>Lexend is a <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=lexend">collection of font families</a> intended to reduce visual stress and to improve reading performance. Primary audience is people with dyslexia and struggling readers but Bonnie Shaver-Troup, creator of the Lexend Project, soon found out that these fonts are also great for everyone else.</p>

<p>The original families (Deca, Exa, Giga, Mega, Peta, Tera, Zetta) are using the "Medium" weight as default, and vary in width and spacing. This version of Lexend is an addition of 8 weights to the original <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Deca">"Deca" family</a> (which has a minimal width and spacing).</p>

<p>True to Bonnieâ€™s vision, Lexend fonts are freely available for all since 2019 in Google fonts. To contribute, see <a href="https://github.com/FontBureau/fb-lexend">github.com/FontBureau/fb-lexend</a>.</p>
