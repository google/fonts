<p>Lexend is a <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=lexend">collection of font families</a> intended to reduce visual stress and to improve reading performance. Primary audience was people with dyslexia and struggling readers, but Bonnie Shaver-Troup, creator of the Lexend Project, soon found out that these fonts were also great for everyone else.</p>

<p>True to Bonnieâ€™s vision, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=lexend">Lexend fonts</a> are freely available for all since 2019 in Google fonts. These different families are using the "Medium" weight as default since it is the most legible one according to her research. This version of Lexend is an addition of 8 weights to the original "Deca" family (which has a minimal width).</p>
