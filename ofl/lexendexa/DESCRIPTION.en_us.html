<p>
Lexend is a collection of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=lexend">seven font families</a> intended to improve reading proficiency.
As prescription eyeglasses achieve proficiency for persons with short-sightedness, Lexend's families were developed using <a href="http://lexend.com">Shaver-Troup Formulations</a>.
</p>

<p>All the Lexend fonts has been upgraded to variable fonts with a weight axis (from Thin to Black) in June 2021, thanks to the efforts of Font Bureau.</p>
