<p>Lexend is a collection of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=lexend">seven font families</a> empirically shown to significantly improve reading-proficiency. As prescription eyeglasses achieve proficiency for persons with short-sightedness, Lexend's families were developed using <a href="https://revreading.org/wp-opt-perf/">Shaver-Troup Formulations</a>.</p>

<p>We will eventually release all seven families as a single variable font featuring its own custom axis.</p>
