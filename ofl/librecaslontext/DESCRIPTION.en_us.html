Libre Caslon Text is a typeface specifically tailored to be used for web body text.
It is based on the artist Caslon’s interpretations (that were typical of 1950s advertising). 
In comparison to lots of digital Caslon's revivals, and lots of Caslon-esque fonts, Libre Calson Text looks very good when printed on paper and 
is also suitable for web body text, achieving good legibility in both instances.

It includes a set of OpenType features and a big Pro character-set covering 103 Latin languages.
