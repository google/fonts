    While most Caslons are based on 18-Century specimens, Libre Caslon is based on the alluring hand-lettered American Caslons of 1960s. Traditionally, Caslon was the very first alphabet that lettering artists learned to draw, so they all were very familiar with it. The work of designing Libre Caslon pulled inpiration from many sources of vintage hand-lettering, but two outshine the rest: One is "Lettering for Advertising" by Mortimer Leach, and "How to Render Roman Letter Forms" by Tommy Thompson.
