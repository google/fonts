Libre Caslon Text is a typeface specifically tailored to be used for web body text.
It is based on the artist - Caslonâ€™s interpretations (that were typical of 1950s advertising). 
In comparison to lots of digital Caslon's revivals, and lots of Caslon-esque fonts, Libre Calson Text looks very good when printed on paper and 
is also suitable for web body text, achieving good legibility in both instances.
