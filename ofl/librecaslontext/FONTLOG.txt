FONTLOG for the Libre Caslon fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Libre Caslon Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Libre Caslon fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

The Libre Caslon fonts are unique Caslons. They are different to all other Caslons out there.

When we were faced with the challenge of making a new Caslon, we asked ourselves: How can we make them different, to bring something new to the table?
We realized that most Caslon revivals were based on 18-Century specimens and that there was a whole genre of Caslons that has been so far ignored: The alluring hand-lettered American Caslons of 1960s.

This was a captivating subject to investigate. Caslon was the very first alphabet that lettering artists learned to draw, so they all were very familiar with it. Our wonder led us to find countless examples of beautifully crafted and elegant vintage ads and hand lettering books. Among those many books, there were two that outshine the rest: One is "Lettering for Advertising" by Mortimer Leach, and the other one is "How to Render Roman Letter Forms" by Tommy Thompson. Both of these books are excellent, highly recommended for all those who want to learn lettering.

So, instead of making just another revival of the types of William Caslon, we preferred to pay homage to 60's lettering artist's Caslon interpretations. And that's how Libre Caslon become different to all other Caslons. (Not better or worse, just different.)

We also decided to make two size-specific subfamilies:
- [Libre Caslon Display](https://github.com/impallari/Libre-Caslon-Display/), a high-contrast Caslon for big headlines.
- [Libre Caslon Text](https://github.com/impallari/Libre-Caslon-Text/), specifically optimized for web body text.

Libre Caslon Text also includes some nice, extra Open Type features:
- 17 ligatures on the regular styles, and 20 ligatures on the italic styles
- Lining Proportional Numbers (Default style).
- Lining Tabular Numbers and punctuation.
- Old Style Proportional Numbers.
- Inferiors, Superiors, Numerators, Denominators.
- Fractions.
- Ordinals.
- The italic style includes an alternate Ampersand (ss01)
