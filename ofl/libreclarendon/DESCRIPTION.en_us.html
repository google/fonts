<p>Libre Clarendon is an integrated and comprehensive Clarendon family. It provides a wide and carefully considered range of weights and widths, allowing it to be used for both Text and Display settings, in all kind of layouts.</p>

<p>Libre Clarendon has 20 styles: 4 widths (Condensed, Narrow, Normal, Wide) in 5 weigths each (Ligth, Regular, Medium, Bold, Black).</p>

<p>Libre Clarendon is loosely based on the original Besley's Clarendon as issued by the Fann Street Foundry in 1874. We kept the almost monoline feeling in it, but expanded into a complete multi-axis family. As a result, it's quite different from the more contrasted Hass/Stempel Clarendon version, already digitized by many foundries.</p>
