The Lobster font took a different approach. 
The new OpenType format gives the possibility to have multiple versions of each letter: 
Instead of compromising the design of the letters to force connections, the technique lettering artists employ is used here. 
Many versions of each letter and a lot of different letter-pairs (aka "ligatures") are drawn, in order to always use the best possible 
variation of each letter depending on the context of the letter inside each word. 
All this happens automatically in any browser that supports ligatures.
