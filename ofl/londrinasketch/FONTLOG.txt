FONTLOG for Londrina Sketch fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Londrina Sketch 
Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Londrina Sketch fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

The Londrina super family is composed of 4 family styles: Solid,
Shadow, Outline and Sketch. You can combine the main style, Solid,
with the others to create different effects. The origins of the New
Folk typeface project is in the streets of Sao Paulo, Brazil: Urban
confusion. Initially made for a poster, I saw at the start some
potential for a typeface that could recall the feelings of the writing
used day-to-day in my city's informal communication. 

This is the Londrina Sketch member of the Londrina family.

Londrina Sketch is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages 
that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be 
expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1
