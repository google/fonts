The Londrina super family is composed of 4 family styles: 
Londrina Solid, 
<a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Londrina+Shadow">Londrina Shadow</a>, 
<a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Londrina+Outline">Londrina Outline</a>, 
and <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Londrina+Sketch">Londrina Sketch</a>. 
You can combine the main style, Solid, with the others to create different effects. 
The origins of the Londrina typeface project is in the streets of Sao Paulo, Brazil: 
Urban confusion. 
Initially I designed the "New Folk" for use in a poster, with only uppercase letters. 
I saw at the start some potential for a typeface that could recall the feelings of the writing used day-to-day in my city's informal communication, and developed it into a typeface family with lowercases too. 
This is the Londrina Outline member of the Londrina family.
