 Lugrasimo is a DocRepair font, intended to improve compliance with the ISO/IEC 29500 standard by providing fallback for Lucida Calligraphy that minimizes text reflow in Office Open XML documents.
 Lugrasimo is based on Fondamento, a typeface in calligraphic lettering style based on the traditional Foundational Hand, a basic teaching style created by Edward Johnston in the early 20th century.
 The letterforms are clear and cleanly legible, basic and formal.
