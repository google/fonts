<p>This project is the Traditional Chinese version of "霞鶩文楷". Initially, it utilized AFDKO in conjunction with the legacy glyph shapes provided by the Zonz community to convert the characters contained in Klee One into old character forms, and supplemented the old version of "霞鶩文楷" with modifications. Some components and characters were further manually modified. Subsequently, reference was made to the "<a href="https://github.com/ichitenfont/inheritedglyphs/blob/master/Readme_eng.md">Inherited Glyph Standardization Documents</a>" from Yidianzifang to modify most components, making it more suitable for Traditional Chinese users and enthusiasts of legacy glyph forms.</p>
