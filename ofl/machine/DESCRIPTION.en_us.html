<p>Machine is a monospaced font originally designed in 1968 by Adrian Frutiger for optical character recognition systems. This version maintains the technical precision of the original while adding modern improvements and extended language support. Its distinctive, machine-readable design makes it ideal for technical documentation, coding environments, and any application requiring clear, consistent character spacing.</p>
<p>The font features a uniform stroke width and carefully designed characters that ensure optimal legibility in both print and digital formats. Its monospaced nature makes it particularly suitable for tabular data and programming contexts where character alignment is crucial.</p>
<p>This version was developed by Rastislav Vašička, bringing improvements to the original design while maintaining its technical essence. The font supports extended Latin characters, making it suitable for use in Eastern European languages.</p>
