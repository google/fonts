FONTLOG for Machine fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Machine
Font Software. This information should be distributed
along with the Machine fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Machine is a monospaced font originally designed in 1968
by Adrian Frutiger for optical character recognition
systems. This version maintains the technical precision
of the original while adding modern improvements and
extended language support. Its distinctive, machine-
readable design makes it ideal for technical documentation,
coding environments, and any application requiring clear,
consistent character spacing.

Machine is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages
that use the Latin script and its variants, including
Eastern European languages.

More specifically, this release supports the following
Unicode ranges: Basic Latin, Latin-1 Supplement, Latin
Extended-A, Latin Extended-B
