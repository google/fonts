Majör Mono Display is a monospaced geometric sans serif all-uppercase typeface which also has a complete set of constructivist display characters with a playful attitude.
It has many OpenType features, but the basic stylistic sets, serious sans serif, and playful display designs, are encoded as lowercase and uppercase characters.
This makes it a great choice for playful web typography, especially at large point-sizes.
