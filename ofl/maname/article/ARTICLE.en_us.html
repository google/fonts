<p>Maname is a text typeface made for Sinhala script with quirky stroke modulation. Maname Latin is informed by the
    modulation of Sinhala companion and takes a versatile lively form.</p>
<p>This project was orignally conceptualised and prototyped by Pathum Egodawatta as a superfamily with many styles and
    scripts in partial fulfilment for the requirements for the Master of Arts in Typeface Design (MATD) at the
    University of Reading, Department of Typography and Graphic Communication in 2016. Since then selected Latin and
    Sinhala components from the academic project were extended to include support for wider Latin character set and
    full Sinhala support under the name Maname.</p>
