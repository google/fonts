<p>Mansalva is a script font that works well for notes and informal text passages. Presents two alternates for each letter and number to provide a natural, handwritten, less mechanical look. It features good legibility for a handwriting typeface and is perfect for a casual-looking annotation. Latest updates include a Latin Plus language coverage currently supporting most Latin-based languages.</p>
