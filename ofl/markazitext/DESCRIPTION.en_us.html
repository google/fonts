The Arabic and Latin takes its cues from Tim Holloway’s award-winning Markazi typeface, affording a contemporary and highly readable experience.
The project was initiated by Gerry Leonidas as a joint University of Reading and Google Fonts project, and happened with Tim’s encouragement.
The Arabic part is a text typeface with moderate contrast, developed by Borna Izadpanah and design directed by Fiona Ross.

The complementary Latin typeface was designed by Florian Runge, echoing key design characteristics of the Arabic counterpart to keeps that spirit, while being rooted in established Latin traditions.
It is an open and clear design with a compact stance and an evenly flowing rhythm.
Available in four weights with extended language support, it is ideally suited for both print and screen typography.
