FONTLOG for the Marmelad font

This file provides detailed information on the Marmelad 
font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Marmelad fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Marmelad is designed specifically for medium to large-size headlines
and remains well-balanced for long text setting because of its regular proportions and medium contrast. Ascenders and descenders are elegant and details refined. The name and overall feel refers to marmalade sweets - soft and ductile.

All vertical strokes are rounded towards the baseline,
which is why technically there is no sense for overshoots in rounded letters like O. Marmelad performs well on screen because of its soft rounded features and generous x-height.

The font supports Latin-1, Cyrillic and Turkish(Latin-5) encoding.
Marmelad is designed by Manvel Shmavonyan.

Marmelad is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin and Cyrillic script and its variants, and 
could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following Unicode
ranges: Latin-1, Latin-5, Cyrillic
