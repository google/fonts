The Martel Devanagari design is a readable typeface whose glyph proportions are inspired by traditional writing and calligraphic styles. 
Its high-contrast strokes have a diagonal axis, in keeping with the pen-angle most often used for the Devanagari writing system.
This Sans design is a low contrast design based on the initial Martel Devanagari.
The Latin character set is an original design. Both character sets are the work of Dan Reynolds and Mathieu RÃ©guer.

The Martel Sans project is led by Dan Reynolds, a type designer based in Berlin, Germany.
