   Matangi is a semi-condensed sans-serif variable typeface that supports both Latin and Devanagari scripts. It includes seven static weights — Light, Regular, 
   Medium, Bold, SemiBold, ExtraBold, and Black — offering a flexible range suitable for titles, headings, logos, and small body text. Started as a personal challenge and a love for 
   typography, this project was a journey of exploration and self-learning, designed to offer a flexible, functional tool for multilingual design. It is also the first 
   variable font project from Nepal, with the hope of benefiting users worldwide.

   The design is based on simple geometric shapes, primarily squares and circles, giving the letterforms a structured, rational character. Subtle inktraps are applied at stroke
   joints for aesthetic purposes, ensuring even typographic color across various sizes and weights. The x-height of the Latin script and the base character height of the Devanagari
   script are carefully aligned to create visual harmony when typesetting both scripts together. Matangi includes over 1,700 glyphs and provides extensive language support, covering 
   more than 150 (Devanagari & Latin Based) languages, primarily including Nepali, Sanskrit, Hindi, Marathi, Awadhi, Dotyali and Latin-based languages. It seamlessly renders 
   extended Sanskrit ligatures and complex Devanagari matras.
