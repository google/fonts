   Matangi is a semi-condensed sans-serif variable typeface that supports both Latin and Devanagari scripts. It includes 
   seven static weights — ExtraLight, Light, Regular, Medium, Bold, ExtraBold, and Black — offering a flexible range suitable
   for titles, headings, logos, and small body text. Started as a personal challenge and a love for typography, this project was a journey of 
   exploration and self-learning, designed to offer a flexible, functional tool for multilingual design. It is also the first variable font project
   from Nepal, with the hope of benefiting users worldwide. 
   
   The design is based on simple geometric shapes, primarily squares and circles, giving the letterforms a structured, rational character.
   Subtle inktraps are applied at stroke joints for aesthetic purposes, ensuring even typographic color across various sizes and weights. The x-height
   of the Latin script and the base character height of the Devanagari script are carefully aligned to create visual harmony when typesetting both scripts together.
   Matangi includes over 1,600 glyphs and provides extensive language support, covering more than 200 (Devanagari & Latin Based) languages, primarily including Nepali, Sanskrit,
   Hindi, Marathi, Awadhi, Dotyali, Eastern Tamang, Goan Konkani, Maharashtrian Konkani, and Latin-based languages. It seamlessly renders
   extended Sanskrit ligatures and complex Devanagari matras.
