<h1><span class="autonym">MATEMASIE</span></h1>
<p>
    Matemasie is an ultra-bold display typeface characterized by rounded edges and a distinctive feature where the shapes
    widen towards the top. It draws inspiration from the Adinkra symbol "Mate Masie," meaning "what I hear, I keep." This 
    symbolizes interconnected ears, emphasizing the importance of listening and communication in oral traditions and cultures.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, Mate Masie embodies principles of wisdom and prudence.

    Adam Yeo, a Type and Graphic Designer originally from Cote d'Ivoire and currently based in France, conceived Matemasie 
    with guidance and technical assistance from mentors Lisa Huang and Nathan Willis.
