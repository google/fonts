MedievalSharp, created by Wojciech Kalinowski around 1995 at the onset of him doing inscriptions on stone professionally, 
is a font used for inscriptions on stone. 
The font is based on gothic letters. Initially it contained only capitals and digits, lowercase and basic signs were added later. 
Suitable for posters, t-shirts or invitations.
