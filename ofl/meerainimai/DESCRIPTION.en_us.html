Meera Inimai is a san-serif typeface. 
It is best used as a screen font for body text.
It is also useful for body text of printed pamphlets or single page designs.  
Usage of Meera Inimai can be thought of similar to Latin grotesque sans serif typefaces.
The Tamil characters are inherently vertically-elliptical and the Latin is naturally based on this characteristic to smoothly sit with the Tamil component.
