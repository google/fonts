<p>'Merienda' is a Spanish term for "afternoon snack", and this pleasant time
of the day was worth its own typography.</p>

<p>Merienda has soft shapes, is slightly condensed, and has a rhythm which is an invitation to read short pieces of text. It is ideal for headlines which call for height, as its strokes resemble those of a brush and deliver freshness and a dynamic touch in the development of words.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merienda+One">Merienda One</a> is the initial publication of this typeface family in a single boldstyle.</p>

<p>In september 2022, the font is updated as a variable and now offers 7 styles, ranging from light to black. The glyphset has also been extended, offering a larger number of supported languages.</p>
