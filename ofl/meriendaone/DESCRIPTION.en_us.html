<p>'Merienda' is a Spanish term for "afternoon snack", and this pleasant time
of the day was worth its own typography.</p>

<p>Merienda has soft shapes, is slightly condensed, and has a rhythm which is
an invitation to read short pieces of text. It is ideal for headlines which
call for height, as its strokes resemble those of a brush and deliver
freshness and a dynamic touch in the development of words.</p>

a second edition of this typeface family, with Regular and Bold styles.</p>
