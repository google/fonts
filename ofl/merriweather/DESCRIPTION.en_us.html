Merriweather was designed to ensure comfortable on-screen readability. 
It is a pleasant serif typeface whose distinctiveness lies in its large x height, slightly condensed letterforms, a mild diagonal stress, sturdy serifs and open forms.
Merriweather conveys a charmingly simple and serene mood that makes it ideal for on-screen digital content, long form copy and quotes

There is also <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather+Sans">Merriweather Sans</a>, a sans-serif version which closely harmonizes with the weights and styles of this serif family.
