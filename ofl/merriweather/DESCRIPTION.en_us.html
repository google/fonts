<p>Merriweather was designed to be a text face that is pleasant to read on
screens.</p>

<p>Merriweather is an evolving project and will be updated. As of now
there are 4 styles: Regular, Light, Bold, and Black. There are now Italic
styles in each of these weights, too.</p>

<p>There is also 
<a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather+Sans">Merriweather Sans</a>,
a sans-serif version which closely harmonizes with the weights and styles of 
this serif family.</p>

<p>Designed by Eben Sorkin, Merriweather features a very large x height,
slightly condensed letterforms, a mild diagonal stress, sturdy serifs and open
forms.</p>

<p>Merriweather is a work in progress and will be improved regularly. This
means you can request improvements and even fund specific features if if they
are outside of the current scope of work. For more information and to stay

<p><strong>Updated in May 2013:</strong> Merriweather has been updated
with a larger character set, and Italic styles have been added for all
weights. (As one of the earliest families published in Google Web Fonts,
Merriweather lacked proper subsetting, so this update introduces a default
'latin' subset that contains less characters, but loads faster. <strong>To use
the full character set, update your API link to include the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started#Subsets">'latin-ext' 
subset</a></strong>.)</p>

<p>
<b>Updated in January 2016:</b> Added a new Cyrillic subset, updated hinting with ttfautohint, updated family naming for better desktop installation, and fixed some OpenType issues. 
Both vertical and horizontal metrics are larger, in the upright or roman styles which may cause text to reflow.
This update features a increase in stroke weight in the upright or roman styles to work better with ttfautohint hinting.
