Merriweather was designed to be a text face that is pleasant to read on screens.
It features a very large x height, slightly condensed letterforms, a mild diagonal stress, sturdy serifs and open forms.

<p>
There is also <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather+Sans">Merriweather Sans</a>, a sans-serif version which closely harmonizes with the weights and styles of this serif family.

The Merriweather project is led by Sorkin Type, a type design foundry based in Western Massachaussets, USA.
