Merriweather Sans is a low-contrast semi-condensed sans-serif typeface family, designed to be pleasant to read at very small sizes. 
Merriweather Sans is traditional in feeling despite the modern shapes it has adopted for screens.
It features a large x height, slightly condensed letterforms, a mild diagonal stress and open forms.

<p>
There are currently 8 styles: Light, Regular, Bold, and ExtraBold weights in Roman and Italic styles.</p>

<p>
There is also <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather">Merriweather</a>, 
a serif version which closely harmonizes with the weights and styles of this sans-serif family.

<b>Updated in January 2016:</b>
This revision improves on-screen rendering especially at text sizes with ttfautohint hinting.
Merriweather Sans will work better when installed on desktops. 
Some OpenType features were added and improved.
Since the vertical and horizontal metrics changed, this may cause some text to reflow in some browsers.
A second update (v1.006) was made on 1/25 to fix ligatures and other digraphs.
