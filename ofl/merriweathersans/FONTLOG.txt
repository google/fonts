FONTLOG for the Merriweather Sans font

This file provides detailed information on Merriweather Sans Font Software. This information should be distributed along with the Merriweather Sans font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Merriweather Sans is a low-contrast semi-condensed sans-serif typeface family designed to be readable at very small sizes. Merriweather Sans is traditional in feeling despite the modern shapes it has adopted for screens. It is a companion to the serif typeface family Merriweather.

Merriweather Sans is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, 
and could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2: Eastern Europe, Turkish, 
Macintosh Character Set and Adobe Latin 3 character set.

There are two source files for each style:

1. MerriweatherSans-Style.vfb Original Source Files with 
   contour overlaps for v1.004 and earlier

2. MerriweatherSans-Style.ufo Original Source Files with 
  contour overlaps for v1.005 and later
