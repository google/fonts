<p>The Soft Type Collection is designed for knitters to chart out their typographic projects. Micro 5 is a teeny-tiny typeface that can fit anywhere on your project.</p>

<p>Each typeface has a “Regular” and “Charted” version, and some include multiple scales so you can fit type on your knits, no matter the project's size.</p>

<p>In this collection, the number following the typeface's name indicates the height of the capital letters for that typeface.</p>

<p>Check out the non-charted version <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Micro+5">Micro 5</a>.</p>
