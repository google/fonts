<p>Milonga is a Font inspired on “tangueros” art. It is a tribute to the
“rioplatense” culture; colorful, full of emotion, family, friends and enemy stories told in
countless Tangos and Milongas (folk music genre from Argentina). 
This graceful, flowing and rhythmic font is formed by graphic elements found in a kind of 
classic painting from this area called “fileteado porteño”; 
with terminations involving petals, round and pointy details.
