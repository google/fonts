SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007  
---------------------------------------------------  

PREAMBLE  
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide  
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation  
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and  
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership  
with others.  

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified, and  
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The  
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,  
redistributed, and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved  
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,  
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The  
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to  
any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.  

DEFINITIONS  
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright  
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may  
include source files, build scripts, and documentation.  

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components  
as distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).  

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,  
or substituting — in part or in whole — any of the components of the  
Original Version, by changing formats, or by porting the Font Software  
to a new environment.  

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical  
writer, or other person who contributed to the Font Software.  

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS  
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to use, copy, modify,  
merge, publish, distribute, and sell copies of the Font Software,  
subject to the following conditions:  

1) The Font Software must be distributed in its original, unmodified form.  
   No modifications may be made to the font files themselves when  
   redistributing them.  

2) Modified Versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be  
   misrepresented as the Original Version.  

3) The name(s) of the Original Version must not be used in any Modified  
   Version without explicit written permission from the Copyright Holder(s).  

4) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, may not be sold by itself.  
   It may be bundled with software, but it cannot be the sole product  
   for sale.  

TERMINATION  
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.  

DISCLAIMER  
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
