Miriam Libre is a mono-linear Hebrew and Latin sans serif font family with two weights, Regular and Bold.
The Hebrew design is a revival of the original Miriam typeface published in 1908 by Raphael Frank.
Miriam Libre brings this design into the 21st century: 
proportions are redesigned; 
unnnecessary elements were removed for a more clean appearance, while keeping the original unique personality; 
more soft curves replace some of the “square” mechanical ones.
The Latin design is original and made to fit the Hebrew and meet the contemporary needs of a bi-lingual font family.

The Miriam Libre project is led by Michal Sahar, a type designer based in Tel Aviv, Israel.
