Modak is a Free and Open Source, Heavy-Chubby Devanagari-Latin display typeface. 
The design started off as a heavy hand sketched letterform exploration. 
The characters were cute/round and not bulky/rigid.

<p>
To increase functionality, additional Matras that would match exactly with every character were designed, 
leaving a thin counter space in between. Custom Ukars were designed according to each character. 
The resulting typeface is one of its kind and probably the chubbiest Devanagari typeface to ever be designed.

Modak Devanagari is designed by Sarang Kulkarni and Maithili Shingre and Modak Latin by Noopur Datye with support from Girish Dalvi.
