Mogra (મોગરા) is a display typeface that supports the Gujarati and Latin scripts.
With dense letterforms that borrow heavily from a broad-nibbed marker, Mogra emphasises the definitive Gujarati out-stroke with mass, weight, and flair. 
The implied bloating of the marker pen creates an interesting roundness that contrasts against the relatively fixed angle the pen holds.

The Mogra project is led by Lipi Raval, a type designer based in Ahmedabad, India.
