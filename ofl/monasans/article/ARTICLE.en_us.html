<p>A strong and versatile typeface, designed together with Degarism and inspired by industrial-era grotesques. Mona Sans works well across product, web, and print. Made to work well together with Mona Sans's sidekick, Hubot Sans.</p>

<p>Mona Sans is a variable font. Variable fonts enable different variations of a typeface to be incorporated into one single file, and are supported by all major browsers, allowing for performance benefits and granular design control of the typeface's weight, width, and slant.</p>
