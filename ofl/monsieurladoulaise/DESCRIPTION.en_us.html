The Charles Bluemlein Script Collection is an intriguing reminder of the heady days of hand lettering and calligraphy in the United States. 
The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - 
by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure.

Alejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of todayâ€™s designer. 
Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein. 
They are elegant hand lettering fonts, perfect for formal invitations, product packaging and editorial needs.
