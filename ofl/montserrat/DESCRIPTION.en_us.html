Work, dedication, care, color, contrast, light and life, day and night, old posters and signs in the traditional Montserrat neighborhood of Buenos Aires, are what inspired Julieta Ulanovsky to design this typeface. 
Montserratâ€™s rounded sans serif configuration makes for easy legibility and is suitable for a variety of graphic design works.

This is the normal family, and it has two sister families so far, <a href="http://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat+Alternates">Alternates</a> and <a href="http://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat+Subrayada">Subrayada</a>. 
Many of the letterforms are special in the Alternates family, while 'Subrayada' means 'Underlined' in Spanish and celebrates a special style of underline that is integrated into the letterforms found in the <em>Montserrat</em> neighborhood.

Updated November 2017: The family was redrawn by Jacques Le Bailly at <a href="http://www.baronvonfonthausen.com/">Baron von Fonthausen</a> over the summer, and the full set of weights were adjusted to make the Regular lighter and better for use in longer texts. 
In fall, Julieta Ulanovsky, Sol Matas, and Juan Pablo del Peral, led the development of Cyrillic support, with consultation with Carolina Giovagnoli, Maria Doreuli, and Alexei Vanyashin.
