Old posters and signs in the traditional <em>Montserrat</em> neighborhood of Buenos Aires, are what inspired Julieta Ulanovsky to design this typeface 
and rescue the beauty of urban typography that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century. 
As urban development changes that place, it will never return to its original form and loses forever the designs that are so special and unique.

This is the Subrayada family, a sister to the <a href="http://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat">normal</a> 
and <a href="http://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat+Alternates">Alternates</a> families. 
Many of the letterforms are special in the Alternates family, while 'Subrayada' means 'Underlined' in Spanish and celebrates a special style of 
underline that is integrated into the letterforms found in the <em>Montserrat</em> neighborhood.

Updated November 2017: The family was redrawn by Jacques Le Bailly at <a href="http://www.baronvonfonthausen.com/">Baron von Fonthausen</a>, 
and the full set of weights were adjusted to make the Regular lighter and better for use in longer texts. 
In fall, Julieta Ulanovsky, Sol Matas, and Juan Pablo del Peral, led the development of Cyrillic support, 
with consultation with Carolina Giovagnoli, Maria Doreuli, and Alexei Vanyashin.
