<p>Mouse Memoirs finds its inspiration from the vintage Mickey Mouse,
Beagle Boys, and Uncle Scrooge comic books put out by Walt Disney in
the 1950's and 60's. This font comes alive with a truly animated look.
Perfect for light-hearted designs, children's books, and fun-themed projects.
It is an all-around fun typeface.</p>
