    Mozilla Headline and Mozilla Text are our custom typefaces for the Mozilla brand. This typeface font family features a unique uniwidth design. It maintains standardized spacing and kerning across all weights and styles, eliminating risk of text reflow to preserve the integrity of the layout and enhance the user’s experience.
