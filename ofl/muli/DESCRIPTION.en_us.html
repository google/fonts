Muli is a minimalist Sans Serif typeface, designed for both display and text typography. 
</p>
<p>
Since the initial launch in 2011, Muli was updated continually by Vernon Adams until 2014.
Vernon added more weights, support for more Latin languages, tightened the spacing and kerning and made many glyph refinements throughout the family based on hundreds of users' feedback.
In 2017 the family was updated by Jacques Le Bailly to complete the work started by Vernon after he passed away, in collaboration with his wife Allison, an arist who holds the trademark on the typeface family name.
In August 2019, it was updated with a Variable Font "Weight" axis.
