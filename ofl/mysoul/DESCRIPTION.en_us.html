Inspired by the lettering popular in the northwest United States in the 1980s, My Soul is a flat pen calligraphic style with capital forms that have been subtly embellished. It's robust weight holds up well at reduced sizes, but be careful as the embellishments may cause a loss of legibility at such sizes.
