<p>Typearture's Nabla: an Isometric COLRv1 font</p>
<p>
    Nabla is a color font inspired by isometric computer games, built using the COLRv1 format. This format allows for smooth gradients, sharp highlights and blended shadows, resulting in a bold and vibrant design. It includes two font variations axes, one for the depth of the letters, the other for the thickness of the highlight, and includes multiple color palettes.
