<p><strong>Nata Sans</strong> is a grotesque sans-serif typeface with a subtle humanist tone, designed by Daniel Uzquiano Cruz.</p>

<p>It was developed with user interfaces in mind, featuring a generous x-height, wide glyphs, and short ascenders and descenders that promote a relaxed and readable rhythm. Nata Sans presents a restrained yet distinct personality, making it a viable alternative to Helvetica in both digital and print contexts.</p>

<p>The typeface includes nine predefined weights from Thin to Black, and is available as a variable font with a weight axis ranging from 100 to 900. All weights interpolate smoothly thanks to three master drawings and cover 1022 glyphs.</p>

<p>Nata Sans supports 219 Latin-based languages spoken across 212 countries. It meets 100% of the <strong>Google Fonts Latin Plus</strong> character set, making it fully equipped for a wide range of global applications.</p>

<p>It also supports Latin, including Vietnamese, and Cyrillic scripts, and implements 18 OpenType features, including stylistic alternates, localized forms, case-sensitive punctuation, tabular and old-style figures, fractions, superscripts, subscripts, and more. Features such as <code>calt</code>, <code>ss01</code>, <code>locl</code>, and <code>kern</code> enhance typographic flexibility across platforms.</p>


<p>The font is released under the SIL Open Font License and is actively maintained on <a href="https://github.com/dnlzqn/nata-sans">GitHub</a></p>
