You will throw tomatoes at Jovanny Lemonad when you find out he invented Neucha for the sake of one phrase: “I love you”. 
It was 2005 and he was in love. The first version of the font was done in 8 hours. 
He recently redid this fastfont from scratch, some glyphs have changed greatly but most of them were not touched – just polished. 
Neucha translated from the Russian language means “not knowing how to create fonts right”.
