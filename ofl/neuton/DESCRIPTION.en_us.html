Neuton is a clean, dark, somewhat Dutch-inspired serif font which reminds you a little of Times. 
It has a large height, short extenders, and a compact width for better screen use, and economy of space.

Sometimes a text needs a different flavor or feel. While one roman can work for a variety of texts, the companion italics don't always. 
In more classical or personal documents, a stiff, sober, modern and down-to-earth italic will never work. 
And in many essays, some of the fancier italics look ridiculous. Who said a roman needs only one companion?
