&quot;Nobile&quot; is designed to work with the technologies of digital screens and handheld devices without losing the distinctive look 
more usually found in fonts designed for printing.

the aim was to design a font that could function well, have good legibility on screen yet also be good looking, 
not only at larger display sizes but also right down to small text sizes.
