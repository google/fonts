<h4>Khitan small script</h4>
<p>Khitan small script is a historical East Asian logo-syllabary. Was used in the 10thâ€“12th centuries by the Khitan in the Liao Empire (north-eastern China) for the Khitan language. Later used by the Jurchens. Two independent writing systems, the Khitan large script and the Khitan small script, were used in parallel.
