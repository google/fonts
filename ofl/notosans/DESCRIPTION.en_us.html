  Noto is a global font collection for writing in all modern and ancient
  languages. Noto Sans is an unmodulated (“sans serif”) design for texts in the
  <em>Latin, Cyrillic</em> and <em>Greek</em> scripts, which is also suitable as
  the complementary choice for other script-specific Noto Sans fonts. It has
  italic styles, multiple weights and widths, and 3,741 glyphs.
