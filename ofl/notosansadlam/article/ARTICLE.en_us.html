<h4>Adlam</h4>
<p>
  Adlam (<span class="autonym">𞤀𞤣𞤤𞤢𞤥 𞤆𞤵𞤤𞤢𞤪</span>) is an African bicameral
  alphabet, written right-to-left. Used for the Fulani (Fula, 65 million
  speakers) language in Guinea, which previously used Latin and Arabic. Created
  around 1989 by two teenage brothers, Ibrahima and Abdoulaye Barry. One of
  indigenous scripts for specific languages in West Africa, currently taught in
  Guinea, Nigeria, Liberia and other countries. Adlam has 28 letters, each in
  four forms. The unjoined variant is suitable for headlines and for educational
  content. The cursive variant, in which letters join the same way as in Arabic
  and N’Ko, is suitable for most texts. Needs software support for complex text
  layout (shaping). Read more on
