  Bassa Vah is an African bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right. Used for
  the Bassa language spoken in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and by communities in
  Brazil and the Caribbean. Developed by Dr. Thomas Flo Lewis from a sign system
  used by the Bassa people to avoid slave traders, later suppressed by colonial
  powers, fell into disuse. Has 23 consonants, 7 vowels, and 5 tone diacritics.
