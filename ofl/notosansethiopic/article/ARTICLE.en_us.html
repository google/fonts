  Ethiopic (Geʽez, <span class="autonym">ግዕዝ, ፊደል</span>) is an African abugida,
  written left-to-right (18 million users). Used for Ethiosemitic languages like
  Tigré, Amharic and Tigrinya and some Cushitic and Nilotic languages. Was used
  in the 1st–12th century CE in Ethiopia and Eritrea for the Geʽez language (now
  a liturgical language). Needs software support for complex text layout
  (shaping). Read more on
