  Mende (Mende Kikakui) is an African abugida, written right-to-left. Used in
  Sierra Leone for the Mende language (2 million speakers). Created by Mohammed
  Turay. Was widely used in the early 20th century, later largely replaced by
  the Latin script. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping).
