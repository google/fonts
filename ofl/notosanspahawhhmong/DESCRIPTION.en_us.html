The Noto project develops fonts to support all the languages in the world. Google has been developing a font family called Noto, which aims to support all languages with a harmonious look and feel. Noto has multiple styles and weights, and is freely available to all. The comprehensive set of font sources and tools used in our development is available in our <a href="https://github.com/notofonts">GitHub repositories</a>.

Noto fonts for many other languages are available as web fonts in <a href="//www.google.com/fonts/earlyaccess">Google Fonts Early Access</a>.
