<h3>Supported writing systems</h3>
<h4>Han (Hanzi, Kanji, Hanja)</h4>
<p>Han (Hanzi, Kanji, Hanja, <span class='autonym'>汉字, 漢字</span>) is an East Asian logo-syllabary, written vertically right-to-left and horizontally left-to-right (over 1.3 billion users). Used at least since the Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BCE) to write the Chinese (Sinitic) languages like Mandarin and Cantonese, but also, today or in the past, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Okinawan, Zhuang, Miao and other languages. The Han script has regional variations: Traditional Chinese (since the 5th century CE, today used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau), Simplified Chinese (used since 1949–1956 in mainland China, Singapore, and Malaysia), Japanese (called Hanji, used together with the Hiragana and Katakana syllabaries in Japan), Korean (called Hanja, widely used for the Korean language since 400 BCE until the mid-20th century). Fundamentally the same characters represent the same or highly related concepts across dialects and languages, which themselves are often mutually unintelligible or completely unrelated. Some 2,100–2,500 Han characters are required for basic literacy, some 5,200–6,300 for reading typical texts. Many more are needed for specialized or historical texts: the Unicode Standard encodes over 94,000 Han characters.

<h4>Hangul</h4>
<p>Hangul (Hangeul, <span class='autonym'>한글</span>, Chosŏn'gŭl, <span class='autonym'>조선글</span>) is an East Asian script, written vertically right-to-left and horizontally left-to-right (79 million users). Used for the Korean language. Created in 1446 by King Sejong the Great (Sejong of Joseon) as a simpler, phonetic alternative to using Chinese hanja for Korean. Not universally accepted for centuries, suppressed by Japanese colonial authorities. Since 1945 the standard script for Korean. The 51 basic letters (jamo) are grouped into syllable blocks depending on their position in the spoken syllable.

<h4>Latin</h4>

Derived from Western Greek, attested in Rome in the 7th century BCE. In the common era, numerous European languages adopted the Latin script along with Western Christian religion, the script disseminated further with European colonization of the Americas, Australia, parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific. New letters, ligatures and diacritical marks were gradually added to represent the sounds of various languages.

Has 21 onset consonants, 16 rhymes, and 4 tone marks.

<h4>Greek</h4>
<p>Greek (<span class='autonym'>Ελληνικά</span>) is a European bicameral alphabet, written left-to-right (11 million users). Used to write the Greek language since the 8th century BCE. Also used to write other languages like Urum, Albanian Tosk, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish. Some symbols are also used in scientific notation. Derived from Phoenician. First “true alphabet”, with distinct letters for consonants and vowels. Standardized in the 4th century BCE by Eucleides. Has 24 letters. Some letter variants (sigma: σ/ς) have positional significance in the Greek language, other variants only differ in meaning in scientific notation (e.g. pi: π/ϖ). The Greek language used to be written in polytonic spelling, with three accents on vowels. In 1982, Greece introduced monotonic spelling with a single diacritic. Needs software support for complex text layout (shaping).
