<h4>Sinhala</h4>
<p>
  Sinhala (<span class="autonym">සිංහල</span>) is an Indic abugida, written
  left-to-right. Used since c. 300 CE in Sri Lanka for the Sinhala language (15
  million speakers), for Pali and Sanskrit. The “pure” letter set has 20
  consonant and 20 vowel letters, and is used for the sounds of the spoken
  Sinhala. The “mixed” letter set (18 more consonant letters) is used for
  correct spelling, which often reflect archaic pronunciations, and for
  non-Sinhala words and languages. Needs software support for complex text
  layout (shaping). Read more on
