Wojciech Kalinowski created the NovaCut font about 14-15 years ago for making inscriptions on stone. 
Initially the font contained only capitals and digits and existed only on paper and stone inscriptions. 
In 2010 he transferred this font to a computer, and made the missing lowercase and some basical signs; it was initially named Gothica..

He made other versions of some letters and created new fonts based on these letters. 
This resulted in seven fonts making up the Nova family.
