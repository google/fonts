Nunito is a well balanced sans serif typeface superfamily, with 2 versions: 
The project began with <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito">Nunito</a>, created by Vernon Adams as a rounded terminal sans serif for display typography. 
Jacques Le Bailly extended it to a full set of weights, and an accompanying regular non-rounded terminal version, Nunito Sans.
