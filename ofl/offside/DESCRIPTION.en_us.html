<p>The main feature of Offside is its simple structure and monoline stroke. It
is modern, slightly condensed, with large counters to achieve excellent
readability on the web, even in small sizes. Its design details make it also
suitable for writing headlines or signage with great clarity and prestige.</p>

<p>The February 2023 update features a bigger glyphset, fractions and some minor aesthetic modifications.</p>
