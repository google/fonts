  Georgian (<span class="autonym">ქართული</span>) is a European alphabet,
  written left-to-right (4.5 million users). Used for the Georgian language of
  Georgia, and other Kartvelian languages. Since 430 CE, the Georgian language
  used an inscriptional form (Asomtavruli), which evolved into a manuscript form
  (Nuskhuri). These are categorized as Khutsuri (ecclesiastical): Asomtavruli is
  uppercase, Nuskhuri is lowercase. Khutsuri is still used for liturgical
  purposes, but was replaced by a new case-less form (Mkhedruli) used for nearly
  all modern Georgian writing. In the 1950s, Akaki Shanidze attempted to add
  Asomtavruli as uppercase and use Mkhedruli for lowercase, but the effort did
  not succeed. Read more on
