<h4>Hebrew</h4>
<p>
  Hebrew (<span class="autonym">עברית</span>) is a Middle Eastern abjad, written
  right-to-left (14 million users). Used for the Hebrew, Samaritan and Yiddish
  languages. Also used for some varieties of Arabic and for the languages of
  Jewish communities across the world. Has 22 consonant letters, 5 have
  positional variants. Vowels in Hebrew language are normally omitted except for
  long vowels which are sometimes written with the consonant letters אהוי (those
  were vowel-only letters until the 9th century). Children’s and school books
  use niqqud diacritics for all vowels. Religious texts may use cantillation
  marks for indicating rhythm and stress. Needs software support for complex
  text layout (shaping). Read more on
