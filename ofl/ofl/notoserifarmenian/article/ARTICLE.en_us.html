  Armenian (<span class="autonym">Հայոց գրեր</span>) is a European bicameral
  alphabet, written left-to-right (12 million users). Created around 405 CE by
  Mesrop Mashtots. Used for the Armenian language to this day. Was widespread in
  the 18th–19th centuries CE in the Ottoman Empire. Armenia uses a reformed
  spelling introduced in the Soviet Union, the Armenian diaspora mostly uses the
  original Mesropian orthography. Read more on
