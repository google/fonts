<p>Ojuju is a reverse contrast Weight axis variable font inspired by African Masquerades. Ojuju draws inspiration from a variety of African traditional dance costumes to inform the design decisions. The masks worn by the Dogon dancers from Mali inspired the aperture shaping, and counterform placement within many of the letterforms. Additionally African movie poster lettering from the 1970's was referenced to round out the design space. Ojuju covers all of the Google's SSA(sub-saharan-african) latin glyphs.</p>
    
<p>This Afro-grotesque style created by Chisaokwu Joboson, is distinct with varying apertures as it moves from extra-light to bold.</p>
