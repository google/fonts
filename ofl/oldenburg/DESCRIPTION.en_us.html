Oldenburg is inspired by nearly monoline handwriting seen on a series of German posters. 
It has been changed and adapted to be a more broadly useful design than a more faithful interpretation would have been. 
Despite the increased utility in Oldernburg it still presents plenty of the whimsical feeling that made its source so attractive. 
Oldenburg can be used a in a wide range of sizes.
