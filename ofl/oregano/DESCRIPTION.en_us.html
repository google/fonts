<p>The Oregano family is based on cartoon style lettering of calligrapher and logo designer, Rand Holub. 
This style of hand lettering adorned many retro brochures and advertisements of the late 40's through the 1960's.</p>

<p>This approachable vintage spunk-filled lettering style exudes a casual
and care free flavor perfect for both on screen and printed materials.</p>
