    Orelega is a whimsical Clarendon font with oversized ears. Its design was based on Sagona Extra Bold by René Bieder,
    but it is not a shameless copy. Everything has been redrawn from the ground up, with many
    new aesthetic changes.

    Orelega is Esperanto for “large-eared”. It is composed of orel- “ear”, -eg- [augments degree or size], and -a
    [adjective ending].
