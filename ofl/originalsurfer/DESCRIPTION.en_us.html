<p>Original Surfer is an offbeat sans serif font with loads of personality. 
Inspired by a vintage advertisement for the "California Cliffs Caravan Park", this font exudes all of the fun of a summer vacation 
anytime of the year. The letterforms are clear and cleanly legible, while nothing is formal or uptight about this font.
Ideal for bold and loud ads and posters.</p>
