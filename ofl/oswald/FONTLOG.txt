FONTLOG for Oswald fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Oswald 
Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Oswald fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Oswald is a reworking of a number of late ninteenth and early Twentieth
century gothics typefaces, this style is best represented by designs such as
'Alternate Gothic'. The characters of Oswald have been re-drawn and reformed
to better fit the pixel grid of standard digital screens. Oswald is designed
to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers,
laptops and mobile devices.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1

For each style there are 4 Source files:

1. FONT-OTF.ufo Original Source Files in UFO format

1. FONT-kern.fea Source kerning file in Adobe OpenType Feature File format

3. Font-TTF.sfd TrueType sources that correspond to the unhinted TTF file

4. FONT-unhinted.ttf TrueType binary, unhinted
