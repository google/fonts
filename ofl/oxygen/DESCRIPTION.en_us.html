<p>The Oxygen typeface family is created as part of the KDE Project, a libre
desktop for the GNU+Linux operating system. The design is optimised for the
FreeType font rendering system and works well in all graphical user
interfaces, desktops and devices.</p>

<p>This is a web font version of Oxygen, designed to be used freely across the
internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.</p>

<p>Oxygen is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use the
Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support other scripts.
