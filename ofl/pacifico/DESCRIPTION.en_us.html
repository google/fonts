Pacifico is an original and fun brush script handwriting font by Vernon Adams which was inspired by the 1950s American surf culture in 2011.
It was redrawn by Jacques Le Bailly at <a href="http://www.baronvonfonthausen.com/">Baron von Fonthausen</a> in 2016.
It was expanded to Cyrillic by Botjo Nikoltchev and Ani Petrova at <a href="https://lettersoup.de">Lettersoup</a> in 2017.

The Pacifico project was commissioned by Google from <a href="https://sansoxygen.com">Vernon Adams</a>, an English type designer who lived in San Clemente, Los Angeles, USA.
