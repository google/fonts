Pacifico is an original and fun brush script handwriting font by Vernon Adams which was inspired by the 1950s American surf culture in 2011.
It is suitable for a range of applications such as bold headlines, cosmetics, book jackets, fashion magazines and greeting cards.
It was redrawn by Jacques Le Bailly at <a href="http://www.baronvonfonthausen.com/">Baron von Fonthausen</a> in 2016.
It was expanded to Cyrillic by Botjo Nikoltchev and Ani Petrova at <a href="https://lettersoup.de">Lettersoup</a> in 2017.

The Pacifico project was commissioned by Google from <a href="https://sansoxygen.com">Vernon Adams</a>, an English type designer who lived in San Clemente, Los Angeles, USA.
