<p>Padauk is a fully capable Unicode 6 font supporting all the Myanmar
characters in the standard. Thus it provides support for minority languages as
well, in both local and Burmese rendering styles.</p>

<p>Padauk includes the necessary Graphite smarts to render the Myanmar script
correctly. Thus if you want to use this font at full fidelity to the
orthography, you will need to use Graphite-capable applications, such as
the latest versions of LibreOffice and Firefox.</p>

<p>Padauk also has OpenType tables which allow it to be rendered in a basic
way, in applications as Word and other web browsers that support OpenType
shaping.</p>
