Padauk is a fully capable Unicode 6 font supporting all the Myanmar characters in the standard.
Thus it provides support for minority languages as well, in both local and Burmese rendering styles.
</p>
<p>
Padauk includes the necessary Graphite smarts to render the Myanmar script correctly. 
Thus if you want to use this font at full fidelity to the orthography, you will need to use Graphite-capable applications, 
such as the latest versions of LibreOffice and Firefox. 
</p>
<p>
Padauk also has OpenType tables which allow it to be rendered in a basic way in applications such as Word and other web browsers that support OpenType shaping.
