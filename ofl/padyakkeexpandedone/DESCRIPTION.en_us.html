    Padyakke is a wide, airy, and friendly font for the Kannada writing system. Its gracefully balanced thin strokes
    rise up over sumptuously swollen bottoms. Padyakke was designed to pair with Aoife Mooney’s latin typeface BioRhyme;
    thus BioRhyme’s idosyncratic bowls, not-quite-perpendicular stroke terminals, and teardrop terminals are also in
    Padyakke.

    Padyakke’s Kannada glyphs were designed by James Puckett. Padyakke’s Latin glyphs were designed by Aoife Mooney.
