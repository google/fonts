Palanquin is a Unicode-compliant Latin and Devanagari text type family designed for the digital age.
The Devanagari is monolinear and was designed alongside the sans serif Latin.

<p>
It currently comprises of seven text weights, and is extended with a heavier display family, <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Palanquin+Dark">Palanquin Dark</a>, that has many subtle design details to accommodate the darker typographic color.
The Palanquin superfamily is versatile and strikes a balance between typographic conventions and that bit of sparkle.
