Pavanam is a Tamil and Latin typeface designed with a focus on greater legibility in smaller sizes for both screen and print media. 
The Latin design is derived from Vernon Adam's <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pontano+Sans">Pontano Sans</a>; 
it has been slightly modified to match with the Tamil typefaces's proportions and vertical metrics.
The word Pavanam means wind in Tamil.

The Pavanam project is led by Tharique Azeez, a type designer based in Sri Lanka.
