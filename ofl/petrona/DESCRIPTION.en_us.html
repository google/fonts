Petrona is inspired by every home's cook, who playfully maneuvers ingredients and decors with a personal touch, 
without derailing from the original recipe. The idea is to add many characteristics to the font without changing its type genre.

<p>
This font has been created like in the kitchen, with sharp elements that forge its structure and with gestural strokes for 
finishing features.</p> <p>Isolated, its glyphs are just ingredients. Caps with heavy asymmetric serifs, and arms of inverted angles, 
offer a certain flavor. Lower cases with great "x" height, pronounced ascenders and soft curves of low contrast, offer a different flavor.  
When combined in a word, they reveal a contemporary bite.  
They get lost when mingled in a paragraph, to integrate again into a new menu which is proposed by the text.

Petronas' expression evokes a personal culinary style; its numbers of uniform height include fractions to describe ingredients.  
This is why connoisseurs recommend it for culinary texts.
