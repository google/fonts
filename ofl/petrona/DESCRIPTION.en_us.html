<p>How many characteristics is it possible to add to a font, without changing its text type genre? Petrona is inspired by every home's cook, who playfully maneuvers ingredients and decors with a personal touch, without derailing from the original recipe.</p> <p>This font has been created like in the kitchen, with sharp elements that forge its structure and with gestural strokes for finishing features.</p> <p>Isolated, its glyphs are just ingredients. Caps with heavy asymmetric serifs, and arms of inverted angles, offer a certain flavor. Lower cases with great "x" height, pronounced ascenders and soft curves of low contrast, offer a different flavor.  When combined in a word, they reveal a contemporary bite.  They get lost when mingled in a paragraph, to integrate again into a new menu which is proposed by the text.</p> <p>Petronas' expression evokes a personal culinary style; its numbers of uniform height include fractions to describe ingredients.  This is why connoisseurs recommend it for culinary texts.  But taste and creativity are personal, for which every one will apply it according to their own preference.</p>
