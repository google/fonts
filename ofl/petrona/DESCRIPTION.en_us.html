<p>How many characteristics is it possible to add to a font without changing its text type genre? Petrona is inspired by every home’s cook, who playfully maneuvers ingredients and decors with a personal touch, without derailing from the original recipe.</p>

<p>This font has been created like in the kitchen, with sharp elements that forge its structure and with gestural strokes for finishing features.</p>

<p>Petrona’s expression evokes a personal culinary style; its numbers of uniform height include fractions to describe ingredients.  This is why connoisseurs recommend it for culinary texts.  But taste and creativity are personal, for which every one will apply it according to their own preference.</p>
