    Phudu is a sans-serif display typeface inspired by Vietnamese hand-lettering billboards in the old days, that
    supports a wide range of languages by Duong Tran. As a new way to achieve variable font, the lighterPhudu gets,
    the extended it becomes, for people to read it easier compared to other lightweight narrow typefaces.

    In the progress of learning and crafting types, Duong has always thought about what makes a Vietnamese typeface.
    If we rewind to the past, we can see a Vietnamese lettering style on the billboard stores, when the artists adapted Latin
    typefaces and then added marks based on their styles. Among those, there were mostly all-caps sans-serif types
    played as descriptions or the store's names themself. To make a new easy-to-read and easy-to-get typeface,
    Duong mixed some of the researched letters from the story above. He doesn't want to just revive the types, he wants to
    improve them to fit the modern-day styles, but still have "Vietnamese" souls in them. The typeface was
    named Phudu (phục dựng) - "revival" in Vietnamese, and has a meaning of timeless (quite the opposite of the name
    when it can be read as "phù du" - ephemeral).
