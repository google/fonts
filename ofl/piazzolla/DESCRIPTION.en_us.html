Piazzolla is a type system intended for optimizing the available space in press media and other publications. It has a compact appearance which allows for small font sizes and tight leading while achieving solid lines and robust paragraphs.
It has a distinctive voice that conveys a personal style, especially in display sizes. It has great performance and readability in small point sizes and long texts, both for screen and printing.
