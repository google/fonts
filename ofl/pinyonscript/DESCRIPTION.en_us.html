<p>Pinyon Script is a romantic round hand script style font. It also sports swashes which are confident and showy somehow giving the type a feeling suggestive of the American west. Perhaps this is why, despite refinement and aristocratic style; Pinyon Script manages to feel so friendly. Pinyon Script uses a high stroke contrast and is very slanted making it most suitable for use at larger sizes.</p>

<p>The last release in June 2022, offers an major language support update.</p>
