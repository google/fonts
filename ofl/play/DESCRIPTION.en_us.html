<p>
Play is a minimalistic sans serif typeface designed by Jonas Hecksher during his time as Type Director of <a href="http://www.playtype.com">Playtype Type Foundry</a>. 
All letters in Play derive from the 'O' – square and circular at the same time. 
Play is designed with large, open counters, ample lowercase x-heights and a corporate, yet friendly appearance. 
The combination of these qualities give Play both a high legibility and readability.
