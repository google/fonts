Playfair is a transitional design. 
During the European Enlightenment in the late 18th century, broad nib quills were replaced by pointed steel pens as the popular writing tool of the day.
Together with developments in printing technology, ink, and paper making, 
print letterforms of high contrast and delicate hairlines that were increasingly detached from the written letterforms became common.

This design lends itself to this period, and while it is not a revival of any particular design, it takes influence from the designs of John Baskerville and from ‘Scotch Roman’ designs.
Being a Display (large size) design in the transitional genre, functionally and stylistically it can accompany Georgia for body text.
