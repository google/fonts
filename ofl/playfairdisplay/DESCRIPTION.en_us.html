Meet Playfair Display, a swanky serif font which lures attention. 
It takes the feel of print letterforms from the European enlightenment period and fine-tunes it.
It works well as captions and headlines.
</p>
<p>
This is the main family, with a sibling <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Playfair+Display+SC">Playfair Display SC</a> small caps family. 
The main family downloaded font files include a full set of small caps, common ligatures, and discretionary ligatures.

<p>
Updated November 2017 with many small improvements and additional language support. The family has been converted to a variable font in August 2019.

The Playfair project is led by Claus Eggers SÃ¸rensen, a type designer based in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
