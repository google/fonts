Playpen Sans is one of the font families produced by TypeTogether after more than two years of primary research into handwriting education for Latin-based languages. It has seven automatic alternates for each character and a built-in shuffler that both ensures variation and avoids repetitive shapes in close proximity. This feature adds to the overall organic, spontaneous, and authentic feel of the handwritten style.

Playpen Sans is a variable font with a weight range from Thin to Extrabold, including support for over 150 Latin-based languages and a set of reward icons.
