	The Austrian Elementary School Curriculum, updated in 2003, stipulates that by
	the end of the second grade, students should achieve legible and fluent
	handwriting based on the <em>Österreichische Schulschrift</em>, or Austrian
	school script. This model was originally created in 1946 drawing upon the
	foundations of <em>German Sütterlinschrift</em>, but underwent several reforms
	before its last version was introduced in 1995.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite Österreich is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to
	Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite Österreich characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This cursive style, available in upright and slanted (italic) versions,
	features oval foundational forms and medium-length extenders. It favors fast
	writing and it is mostly joined, but some letters with crossbars require pen
	lifts. Uppercase letters are cursive and semi-joined. Notable shapes include
	Kurrent-style 't,' an 'f' with a loopless descender, a crossbar in 'Z', and
	knots in certain lower cases.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
</p>

<h4>How to use the fonts in apps?</h4>

	The Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected
	writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually
	activated.

	in text editors. If you use the common 'B' button, you will automatically
