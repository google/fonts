The Austrian Elementary School Curriculum, updated in 2003, stipulates that by the end of the second grade, students should achieve legible and fluent handwriting based on the <i>Österreichische Schulschrift</i>, or Austrian school script. This model was originally created in 1946 drawing upon the foundations of <i>German Sütterlinschrift</i>, but underwent several reforms before its last version was introduced in 1995.

<h4>Playwrite Österreich characteristics</h4>

<p>
This cursive style, available in upright and slanted (italic) versions, features oval foundational forms and medium-length extenders. It favors fast writing and it is mostly joined, but some letters with crossbars require pen lifts. Uppercase letters are cursive and semi-joined. Notable shapes include Kurrent-style 't,' an 'f' with a loopless descender, a crossbar in 'Z', and knots in certain lower cases.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.
