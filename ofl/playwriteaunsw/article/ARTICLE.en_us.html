All Australian provinces employ modern cursive letters for handwriting education, which are taught in a progressive manner. But each state teaches its own version of this style, locally known as ‘script‘, and state-level departments of education offer guidelines and, in some cases, resources for schools and teachers.
</p>
<p>
The adoption of the current models and approach can be traced back to 1990, when the Australian Education Council (AEC) recommended that all schools in the country should adopt a handwriting style based on Scottish calligrapher Tom Gourdie’s Simple Modern Hand. The AEC advocated for a consistent style in handwriting instruction across the country so students relocating across states and territories would not face difficulties. Despite starting from the same source, today the <a href="https://fonts-dev.sandbox.google.com/?query=Playwrite+Australia">five main handwriting models</a> have diverged somewhat in their details.
</p>
<p>
Playwrite Australia NSW is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite Australia NSW characteristics</h4>

<p>
This semi-connected, slanted modern cursive features print-style capital letters. It is characterized by loopless extenders and letters with descenders that do not connect to the following letter. Construction exhibits an overall high stroke speed. Key features include an open 'G' without a crossbar and a uniquely designed 'Y'. The lowercase 'f' is disconnected and has a straight descender. The letters 'b' and 'p' feature closed bowls, enhancing their distinctiveness. Both 'r' and 'z' are presented in an italic style, contributing to the script's elegant and streamlined.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.
