    Playwrite Australia TAS Guides is a single-weight font designed to harmonize seamlessly with its companion, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+AU+TAS">Playwrite Australia TAS</a>. This font includes guideline markers on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders, providing a visual aid for primary school children. These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.

	All Australian provinces employ modern cursive letters for handwriting
	education, which are taught in a progressive manner. But each state teaches its
	own version of this style, locally known as ‘script‘, and state-level
	departments of education offer guidelines and, in some cases, resources for
	schools and teachers.
</p>
<p>
	The adoption of the current models and approach can be traced back to 1990,
	when the Australian Education Council (AEC) recommended that all schools in the
	country should adopt a handwriting style based on Scottish calligrapher Tom
	Gourdie’s Simple Modern Hand. The AEC advocated for a consistent style in
	handwriting instruction across the country so students relocating across states
	and territories would not face difficulties. Despite starting from the same
	source, today the
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=Playwrite+Australia">
    five main handwriting models</a>
	have diverged somewhat in their details.

<h4>Playwrite Australia Tasmania Guides characteristics</h4>

<p>
	Guidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing. To create a versatile font for teachers designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. It replaces the glyph shape with the guidelines and matches the width of the letter space.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
