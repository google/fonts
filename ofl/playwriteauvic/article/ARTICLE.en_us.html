<p>
	All Australian provinces employ modern cursive letters for handwriting
	education, which are taught in a progressive manner. But each state teaches its
	own version of this style, locally known as ‘script‘, and state-level
	departments of education offer guidelines and, in some cases, resources for
	schools and teachers.
</p>
<p>
	The adoption of the current models and approach can be traced back to 1990,
	when the Australian Education Council (AEC) recommended that all schools in the
	country should adopt a handwriting style based on Scottish calligrapher Tom
	Gourdie’s Simple Modern Hand. The AEC advocated for a consistent style in
	handwriting instruction across the country so students relocating across states
	and territories would not face difficulties. Despite starting from the same
	source, today the
	<a href="https://fonts-dev.sandbox.google.com/?query=Playwrite+Australia">
    five main handwriting models</a>
	have diverged somewhat in their details.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite Australia Victoria is a variable font with a weight range from Thin
	(100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite Australia Victoria characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This modern cursive includes elements of continuous cursive styles, such as the
	open bowls in 'b' and 'p'. The only loop is on the ascender of 'f', while 'm'
	and 'n' feature curved entry strokes. Letters with descenders, except for 'f',
	do not connect to the next letter, giving a more distinct and clear
	semi-connected appearance. The 'z' has a very open design with a descender. In
	line with other Australian models, 'g' also features an open design. 'M' is
	noted for its plain legs, and 'q' ends with a small exit stroke.

	four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
</p>
