	The Dutch-French language divide in Belgium, a phenomenon with roots stretching
	back to the Middle Ages, continues to be relevant in the country today.
	Traditions of handwriting education exemplify this circumstance and reflect the
	country's historical ties to France and the Netherlands. Regardless of the
	handwriting model adopted, students learn print-style script letters in
	kindergarten and progress to connected letters in primary school. In Flanders,
	there is a preference for sloped continuous cursive writing, reminiscent of
	Dutch handwriting models, whereas the French-speaking community in the
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+BE+WAL">
    Walloon region opts for upright cursive writing</a>, a style that enjoys popularity in France. This diversity in handwriting
	education is a direct response to Belgium's rich linguistic culture, leading to
	the introduction of a second official language early in the school years.

<p>
	Playwrite België Vlaams Gewest is a variable font with a weight range from Thin
	(100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite België Vlaams Gewest characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This style is a slanted, fully connected continuous cursive. It features
	decorative capital letters, some of which, like 'A', closely resemble a cursive
	structure. The extenders are of medium length, enhancing the fluidity. 'T' and
	'Z' are designed with a crossbar, while 'X' includes loops that facilitates
	continuous writing without lifting the pen. The 'S' maintains a straight spine.
	The lowercase 'f' features only a top loop, connecting from its crossbar, and
	the 't' has a crossbar that extends only to the right, giving it a distinctive
	appearance.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
