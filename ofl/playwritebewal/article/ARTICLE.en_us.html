The Dutch-French language divide in Belgium, a phenomenon with roots stretching back to the Middle Ages, continues to be relevant in the country today. Traditions of handwriting education exemplify this circumstance and reflect the country's historical ties to France and the Netherlands. Regardless of the handwriting model adopted, students learn print-style script letters in kindergarten and progress to connected letters in primary school. In Flanders, there is a preference for <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+BE+VLG">sloped continuous cursive writing</a>, reminiscent of Dutch handwriting models, whereas the French-speaking community in the Walloon region opts for upright cursive writing, a style that enjoys popularity in France. This diversity in handwriting education is a direct response to Belgium's rich linguistic culture, leading to the introduction of a second official language early in the school years.

<h4>Playwrite België Walloon characteristics</h4>

<p>
This upright cursive style features very long extenders and is executed at a slow speed. The capitals are decorative, with features like crossbars in 'T' and 'Z', and a vertical spine in 'S'. The lowercase letters adhere to a continuous, fully connected cursive style, incorporating loops, knots, and curved entry strokes. Notable details include a flat-topped 'z' with a knot and a 't' with a single-sided crossbar, enhancing the ornate nature of this script.
