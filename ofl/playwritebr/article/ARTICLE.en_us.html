	Educational Vertical cursive models first appeared in the 19th century in
	France, England, and the USA as simplified forms of their predecessors,
	Roundhand and Spencerian styles, respectively. The upright cursive writing did
	not enjoy a long period of popularity in northern European and Anglo-American
	countries. It was, however, widely adopted in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and
	France, where it is still used. From these countries, it traveled to erstwhile
	colonies such as Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, among others. In
	Brazil, this resulted in the replacement of the then-popular models of
	handwriting, such as Palmer from the
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+US+Trad">US</a> and
	commercial Roundhand script from England, with the vertical cursive approach.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite Brasil is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to
	Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite Brasil characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This style features a vertical continuous cursive with medium-length extenders,
	round letters, and a slow curve speed. The capital letters are predominantly
	cursive, with many designed to connect seamlessly to the following lowercase
	letters. 'Q' is notably distinctive in shape. Many lowercase letters begin with
	curved entry strokes. The letter 'q' includes a crossbar, 'f' features a
	mirrored bottom loop, and 'z' is characterized by a round form with a looped
	descender.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
