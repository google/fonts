	The traditional method of handwriting instruction in Canada is called
	<em>MacLean’s Method of Writing</em>, and was developed by educator Henry
	Boyver MacLean in the mid-20th century. Building upon letter shapes devised by
	Austin Norman Palmer in the
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+US+Trad">United States</a>, MacLean introduced several changes to suit the needs of school instruction,
	such as modifications to teaching methods and the addition of motor preparation
	exercises. Even though MacLean’s books have not been used in Canada for several
	years, his letter shapes survive in schoolbooks published by regional
	governments and private publishing houses. They are widely used in the majority
	of Canadian primary schools.

<p>
	Playwrite Canada is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to
	Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite Canada characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This slanted continuous cursive style is influenced by the Zaner-Bloser and
	D'Nealian models. It includes cursive uppercase letters, with some particularly
	intricate ones like 'I', 'J', and 'G'. The lowercase letters feature
	medium-length extenders with loops, which are consistent even in letters like
	'p' and 'q', and are constructed using medium-speed strokes. Additionally,
	several lowercase letters such as 'm', 'n', 'v', 'w', 'y', and 'z' start with
	curved entry strokes at the x-height.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
</p>
