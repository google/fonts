	The most prevalent style of handwriting taught in Chile is known as
	<em>‘letra ligada’</em>, or joined letters. This form of cursive handwriting is
	introduced to children as early as 6 years old, either alongside print letters
	or as a standalone style. It can be seen as a slantless variant of
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+GB+J">English roundhand</a>, a calligraphic style that emerged in England, gaining widespread popularity
	in the 18th century, but Chilean type designers note that, while there are
	structural similarities between the two styles, there are also notable
	differences. For instance, <em>letra ligada</em> typically features shorter
	ascenders and descenders, and its uppercase letters are less ornate. This
	divergence is present in both contemporary typographic and calligraphic
	examples.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite Chile is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to
	Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite Chile characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This upright continuous cursive features a mix of uppercase styles. Letters
	like 'A' and 'N' are plain and cursive, whereas others such as 'Q' and 'T' are
	more decorative and intricate. The lowercase letters have medium-length
	extenders with loops and are characterized by their rounded forms and slow
	stroke speed. The letter 'q' is distinguished by a mirrored loop on its
	descender. The 'o' includes a knot, and the letters 'm', 'n', 'v', 'w', 'y',
	and 'z' begin with curved entry strokes.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
</p>
