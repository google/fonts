    Playwrite Chile Guides is a single-weight font designed to harmonize seamlessly with its companion, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+CL">Playwrite Chile</a>. This font includes guideline markers on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders, providing a visual aid for primary school children. These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	The most prevalent style of handwriting taught in Chile is known as
	<em>‘letra ligada’</em>, or joined letters. This form of cursive handwriting is
	introduced to children as early as 6 years old, either alongside print letters
	or as a standalone style. It can be seen as a slantless variant of
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+GB+J">English roundhand</a>, a calligraphic style that emerged in England, gaining widespread popularity
	in the 18th century, but Chilean type designers note that, while there are
	structural similarities between the two styles, there are also notable
	differences. For instance, <em>letra ligada</em> typically features shorter
	ascenders and descenders, and its uppercase letters are less ornate. This
	divergence is present in both contemporary typographic and calligraphic
	examples.

<h4>Playwrite Chile Guides characteristics</h4>

<p>
	Guidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing. To create a versatile font for teachers designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. It replaces the glyph shape with the guidelines and matches the width of the letter space.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
