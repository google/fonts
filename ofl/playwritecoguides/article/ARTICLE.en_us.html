    Playwrite Colombia Guides is a single-weight font designed to harmonize seamlessly with its companion, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+CO">Playwrite Colombia</a>. This font includes guideline markers on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders, providing a visual aid for primary school children. These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	The Colombian cursive style <em>‘letra pegada’</em> is visibly rooted in the
	traditions of the Palmer method, created by Austin Palmer (1860–1927) in the
	United States at the turn of the last century. It has many similarities with
	cursive writing models in North American countries (<a
		href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+US+Trad">
    United States</a>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+MX">México</a>, and
	Canada), which also descend from the same style. This influence can be seen in
	the <em>‘cartillas’</em> or handwriting education booklets produced by private
	publishers, which play an essential role in the teaching of reading and writing
	in the country.

<h4>Playwrite Colombia Guides characteristics</h4>

<p>
	Guidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing. To create a versatile font for teachers designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. It replaces the glyph shape with the guidelines and matches the width of the letter space.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
