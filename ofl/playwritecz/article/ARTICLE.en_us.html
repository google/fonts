There are two main models used for handwriting education in the Czech Republic. The first, known as <i>Zjednodušená psací latinka</i>, or Simplified Latin script, is a continuous cursive hand. This model was officially ratified by the education ministry of erstwhile Czechoslovakia in 1932 and underwent its last revision in 1978. The second model, Comenia Script, features unjoined letters and was endorsed by the ministry in 2012. The national curriculum, which was last published in 2013, provides no further prescriptions about handwriting, and as a result, schools have the autonomy to select either model for instruction.

Playwrite Česko is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite Česko characteristics</h4>

<p>
This sloped continuous cursive style includes decorative capital letters. 'A' and 'H' feature looped crossbars, while 'G' has a cursive structure but lacks a descending stroke. 'M' and 'N' are constructed differently, with only one following a cursive format. The lowercase letters have looped ascenders and descenders. Curved entry strokes appear in 'm', 'n', and 'v', but are absent in 'w'. The letter 'q' includes a mirrored loop in its descender.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.
