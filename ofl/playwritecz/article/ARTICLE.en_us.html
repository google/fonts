	There are two main models used for handwriting education in the Czech Republic.
	The first, known as <em>Zjednodušená psací latinka</em>, or Simplified Latin
	script, is a continuous cursive hand. This model was officially ratified by the
	education ministry of erstwhile Czechoslovakia in 1932 and underwent its last
	revision in 1978. The second model, Comenia Script, features unjoined letters
	and was endorsed by the ministry in 2012. The national curriculum, which was
	last published in 2013, provides no further prescriptions about handwriting,
	and as a result, schools have the autonomy to select either model for
	instruction.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite Česko is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to
	Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite Česko characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This sloped continuous cursive style includes decorative capital letters. 'A'
	and 'H' feature looped crossbars, while 'G' has a cursive structure but lacks a
	descending stroke. 'M' and 'N' are constructed differently, with only one
	following a cursive format. The lowercase letters have looped ascenders and
	descenders. Curved entry strokes appear in 'm', 'n', and 'v', but are absent in
	'w'. The letter 'q' includes a mirrored loop in its descender.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
</p>

<h4>How to use the fonts in apps?</h4>

<p>
	The Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected
	writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually
	activated.
</p>
<p>
	Note: This font family doesn't include Bold or Italic styles, so please avoid
	applying them in text editors. If you use the common 'B' and 'I' buttons, you
	will automatically generate low-quality styles.
