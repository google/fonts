<p>
	In Germany, education is regulated at the state level rather than at the
	national level. Each state defines its own models and methods of teaching
	handwriting in primary schools. The common goal is acquiring a personal style
	of connected handwriting at the end of primary school in fourth grade (10-11
	years old). Emphasis is on the flow of connected writing, letter recognition,
	and legibility, not the exact imitation of individual letters.
</p>
<p>
	In most states, teachers and schools can choose from three cursive styles:
	Ausgangsschrift (LA),
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DE+VA">
	Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift (VA)</a>, and
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DE+SAS">
	Schulausgangsschrift (SAS)</a>. But in 2010, the <em>Grundschulverband</em>, 
    or Association of Primary Schools, presented an alternative progressive approach 
    for handwriting	teaching:
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DE+Grund">Grundschrift</a>, 
    based primarily on a print-style script with some added cursive elements,
	like <em>Häckchen</em>, or exit strokes. Some German states, like Bremen and
	Hamburg, allow this method to be used in schools, in addition to the dominant
	Ausgangschrift systems. According to Das Deutsche Schulportal, Grundschrift is
	taught in 10% of all German schools.

<p>
	Playwrite Deutschland Lateinische Ausgangsschrift is a variable font with a
	weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150
	Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite Deutschland Lateinische Ausgangsschrift characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This style is a very slanted continuous cursive with slightly decorative
	uppercase letters. Notably, 'A' includes a looped bar, 'S' has a straight
	spine, 'Z' features a crossbar, and 'X' showcases a double loop, allowing it to
	be drawn in a single fluid movement, similar to its lowercase counterpart. The
	lowercase letters have short ascenders and descenders, most with loops
	facilitating continuous writing. Letters 'm', 'n', 'r', 'v', 'w' begin with
	curved entry strokes, while 'r' and 'z' display an italic structure. The letter
	'f' is characterized by an ascender loop and a straight descender.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
</p>
