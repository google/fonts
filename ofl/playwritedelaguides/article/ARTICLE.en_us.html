    Playwrite Deutschland Lateinische Ausgangsschrift Guides is a single-weight font designed to harmonize seamlessly with its companion, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DE+LA">Playwrite Deutschland Lateinische Ausgangsschrift</a>. This font includes guideline markers on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders, providing a visual aid for primary school children. These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.

	In Germany, education is regulated at the state level rather than at the
	national level. Each state defines its own models and methods of teaching
	handwriting in primary schools. The common goal is acquiring a personal style
	of connected handwriting at the end of primary school in fourth grade (10-11
	years old). Emphasis is on the flow of connected writing, letter recognition,
	and legibility, not the exact imitation of individual letters.
</p>
<p>
	In most states, teachers and schools can choose from three cursive styles:
	Ausgangsschrift (LA),
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DE+VA">
	Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift (VA)</a>, and
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DE+SAS">
	Schulausgangsschrift (SAS)</a>. But in 2010, the <em>Grundschulverband</em>, 
    or Association of Primary Schools, presented an alternative progressive approach 
    for handwriting	teaching:
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DE+Grund">Grundschrift</a>, 
    based primarily on a print-style script with some added cursive elements,
	like <em>Häckchen</em>, or exit strokes. Some German states, like Bremen and
	Hamburg, allow this method to be used in schools, in addition to the dominant
	Ausgangschrift systems. According to Das Deutsche Schulportal, Grundschrift is
	taught in 10% of all German schools.

<h4>Playwrite Deutschland Lateinische Ausgangsschrift Guides characteristics</h4>

<p>
	Guidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing. To create a versatile font for teachers designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. It replaces the glyph shape with the guidelines and matches the width of the letter space.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
</p>
