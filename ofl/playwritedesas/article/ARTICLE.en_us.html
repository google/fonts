In Germany, education is regulated at the state level rather than at the national level. Each state defines its own models and methods of teaching handwriting in primary schools. The common goal is acquiring a personal style of connected handwriting at the end of primary school in fourth grade (10-11 years old). Emphasis is on the flow of connected writing, letter recognition, and legibility, not the exact imitation of individual letters.

In most states, teachers and schools can choose from three cursive styles: <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DE+LA">Ausgangsschrift (LA)</a>,  <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DE+VA">Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift (VA)</a>, and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DE+SAS">Schulausgangsschrift (SAS)</a>. But in 2010, the <i>Grundschulverband</i>, or Association of Primary Schools, presented an alternative progressive approach for handwriting teaching: <i>Grundschrift</i>, based primarily on a print-style script with some added cursive elements, like <i>Häckchen</i>, or exit strokes. Some German states, like Bremen and Hamburg, allow this method to be used in schools, in addition to the dominant Ausgangschrift systems. According to Das Deutsche Schulportal, Grundschrift is taught in 10% of all German schools.

<h4>Playwrite Deutschland Schulausgangschrift characteristics</h4>

<p>
This continuous cursive features a medium slope, short extenders, and a deliberately slow stroke speed. The capital letters present a restrained appearance, with only a few exhibiting decorative or cursive traits. The lowercase letters have looped ascenders and descenders, and 'm', 'n', and 'r' begin with a curved entry stroke. This typeface displays a German-style 't' that can be executed without lifting the pen. The letter 'f' has a straight and loopless descender, while 'r' and 'z' are designed with an italic structure.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.
