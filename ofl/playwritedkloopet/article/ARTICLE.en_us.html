	In 2019, the Ministry of Children and Education outlined the government's
	primary education requirements in a document called "Danish Common Goals". It
	specifies that second-grade students must be able to write upper and lowercase
	letters by hand and using the keyboard, and by fourth grade they are expected
	to write in legible, connected handwriting. Accordingly, handwriting
	instruction starts during preschool with simplified print letters. Given the
	autonomy to choose their preferred teaching methods and models, teachers and
	schools opt between two cursive models during the middle of the second or the
	beginning of the third year —
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DK+Uloopet">
    the unlooped <em>Grundskrift</em></a>, or its looped variation known as <em>Grundskrift med løkker</em>.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite Danmark Loopet is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100)
	to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite Danmark Loopet characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This typographic hybrid draws from fully joined modern cursives but includes
	looped ascenders. It features a slanted orientation with short ascenders and
	descenders, creating a round and restrained appearance. The capital letters are
	mostly simplified and print-like, with a very distinctive 'G' that lacks both a
	descender and a crossbar. The lowercase letters connect with each other, except
	for 'q'. A standout feature is the lowercase 'b', which combines a modern
	cursive shape and connecting stroke with an uncharacteristic loop on its
	ascender.

<p>
	Playwrite Danmark Loopet appears in font menus with a two-letter country code
	‘DK’ and a the word ‘Loopet’ abbreviation <strong>Playwrite DK Loopet</strong>. It
	features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
