Primary school handwriting in Spain features letters that are cursive from a structural standpoint but have no slant. These upright cursive letters are either taught in the form of a hybrid style, which uses joined cursive lowercase letters with unjoined simplified print uppercase, or as a fully cursive style, which features ornate, and more traditional and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+ES+Deco">decorative uppercase letters</a>. The hybrid style is used in textbooks by major educational publishers, such as <i>Cuadernos Rubio, Santillana Educación, Editorial Barcanova,</i> and <i>Tekman Education</i>.
</p>
<p>
Playwrite España is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite España characteristics</h4>

<p>
This continuous cursive is inspired by traditional French models, featuring medium-length ascenders and descenders with loops. Several lowercase letters begin with curved entry strokes, and a few, such as 'b' and 'p', include knots. The letter 'z' is distinctively styled in italic fashion, adding a recognizable touch to this script. The uppercase letters are simplified and print-like, with the letter 'I' notably having serifs.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.
