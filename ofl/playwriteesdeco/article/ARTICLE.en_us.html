	Primary school handwriting in Spain features letters that are cursive from a
	structural standpoint but have no slant. These upright cursive letters are
	either taught in the form of a hybrid style, which uses joined cursive
	lowercase letters with unjoined
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+ES">
    simplified print uppercase</a>, or as a fully cursive style, which features ornate, and more traditional and
	decorative uppercase letters. The hybrid style is used in textbooks by major
	educational publishers, such as Cuadernos Rubio, Santillana Educación,
	Editorial Barcanova, and Tekman Education.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite España Decorativa is a variable font with a weight range from Thin
	(100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite España Decorativa characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This continuous cursive is influenced by traditional French models and features
	medium-length ascenders and descenders with loops. Several lowercase letters
	begin with curved entry strokes, and some incorporate knots. The 'z' is
	uniquely styled in italic fashion, which stands out in this script. In contrast
	to its more simplified sibling, this model boasts cursive-style capital
	letters. Notably, the 'X' includes a double knot, and the 'T' is distinguished
	by a decorative crossbar.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
