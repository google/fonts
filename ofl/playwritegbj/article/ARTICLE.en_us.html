<p>
	England has been the incubator for several prominent handwriting styles that
	still influence teaching around the world. One of the earliest examples is the
	English Roundhand, which was used in business and education in the 19th
	century.
</p>
<p>
	The implementation of modern cursive styles in classrooms is probably the most
	influential development for contemporary handwriting education. They draw from
	the ideas of the Italic Handwriting Revival movement of the early 20th century,
	and the work of its proponents. Alfred Fairbank (1895–1982) proposed modern
	italic writing, based on chancery models, as a new approach to teaching
	handwriting with the aim of simplification and faster writing speed. Recently,
	it has been one of the most popular approaches to handwriting teaching in
	England. Of the twenty-three methods described in the National Handwriting
	Association’s 2013 guide to writing methods for teaching, thirteen were fully
	joined or
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+GB+S"> semi-joined </a>
	modern cursive styles. Important among these are Nelson Handwriting, Tom
	Gourdie Modern Hand, Jarman Handwriting, Marion Richardson, and
	Sassoon-Williams model.

<p>
	Playwrite England Joined is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100)
	to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite England Joined characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This fully connected modern cursive has short, loopless ascenders and looped
	descenders, and is available in two flavors: upright and slanted (italic). It
	has simplified print upper cases. The most identifiable features are the open
	'G' with no crossbar and the 'M' with splain legs. Lowercase 'f' is its more
	recognizable feature, with an ascender that requires lifting the pen. As
	expected in this style, the letters 'r' and 'z' have an italic cursive
	structure.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
</p>
