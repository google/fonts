	England has been the incubator for several prominent handwriting styles that
	still influence teaching around the world. One of the earliest examples is the
	English Roundhand, which was used in business and education in the 19th
	century.
</p>
<p>
	The implementation of modern cursive styles in classrooms is probably the most
	influential development for contemporary handwriting education. They draw from
	the ideas of the Italic Handwriting Revival movement of the early 20th century,
	and the work of its proponents. Alfred Fairbank (1895–1982) proposed modern
	italic writing, based on chancery models, as a new approach to teaching
	handwriting with the aim of simplification and faster writing speed. Recently,
	it has been one of the most popular approaches to handwriting teaching in
	England. Of the twenty-three methods described in the National Handwriting
	Association’s 2013 guide to writing methods for teaching, thirteen were
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+GB+J">fully joined</a> or
	semi-joined modern cursive styles. Important among these are Nelson
	Handwriting, Tom Gourdie Modern Hand, Jarman Handwriting, Marion Richardson,
	and Sassoon-Williams model.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite England SemiJoined is a variable font with a weight range from Thin
	(100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite England SemiJoined characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This semi-connected modern cursive is offered in both upright and slanted
	(italic) versions. It features short, loopless ascenders and descenders, with
	simplified print-like uppercase letters. Notable characteristics include an
	open 'G' without a crossbar and an 'M' with plain legs. The lowercase 'f' has a
	curved descending stroke, and the 'q' is distinguished by a flick in its
	descender. True to this style, there are no curved entry strokes, and letters
	ending in a right-to-left stroke, such as 'b', 'p', 'g', and 's', do not
	connect to the following letter.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
</p>
