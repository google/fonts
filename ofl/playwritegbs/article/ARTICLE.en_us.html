Playwrite is a typeface engine that allows the creation of primary school cursive fonts. This typeface is the practical result of the Primarium research project <a href="https://primarium.info">primarium.info</a> which studies handwriting instruction methodologies around the world. Its findings with regards to the calligraphic models currently in use, their development and rationale, informed the design of the Playwrite glyphs.

<p>
The shape of the handwritten Latin alphabethas developed following different currents, trends and colonial influences around the world. As a result, the very notion of what constitutes primary school cursive writing varies dramatically. It could be vertical or slanted, fully joined or semi-joined, uppercase letters can be ornate and decorative or simply borrowed from print styles, lowercase letters can be based on round or oval foundational shapes, and the proportion of the x-height vis-a-vis the ascenders and descenders can differ.

The Playwrite England Semijoined model is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.
