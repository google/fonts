	The seeds for the standardization of Croatian handwriting education were sown
	in 2007 when the Ministry of Education promoted a series of research projects
	that yielded numerous resources focused on Croatian language education,
	particularly for reading and writing. Among these was a handbook for
	handwriting education by Ante Bežen and Siniša Reberski, an influential work in
	the standardization of handwriting instruction from 2013 onwards. In first
	grade, students match letters with sounds and learn to recognize them in the
	context of words by means of print-style letters. From second grade, students
	must write using a continuous and fully joined cursive called
	<em>‘rukopisno pismo’</em>.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite Hrvatska is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to
	Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite Hrvatska characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This is a slanted continuous cursive handwriting model with short looped
	ascenders and descenders. The uppercase letters are slightly decorative, with
	some designed to facilitate connecting strokes. Distinctively, the lowercase
	letters 'm' and 'n' do not have a curved entry stroke, whereas 'r', 'v', 'w',
	and 'y' do. The construction of these letters is characterized by a slow,
	rounded, and careful approach.

<h4>Family name in font menus</h4>
<p>
	Playwrite Hrvatska appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘HR’,
	<strong>Playwrite HR</strong>, and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and
	Regular.
	<br />
	The download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts
	for each style.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
</p>
