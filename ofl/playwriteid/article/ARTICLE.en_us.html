	The Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture introduced a standard,
	national model for handwriting education through an official decree in 1983.
	The model was updated in 2009, but the original is still preferred. According
	to the model, students first <em>‘learn huruf‘</em> lepas, or loose letters,
	followed by <em>‘huruf sambung‘</em>, or cursive letters. Across the country,
	handwriting is taught using this model, and it is featured in workbooks
	produced by popular private publishers in Indonesia.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite Indonesia is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to
	Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite Indonesia characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This style uses the traditional French model as its basis. It features upright,
	connected cursive letters with notably long ascenders and descenders. The
	letters, characterized by their rounded shapes, are written slowly. Capital
	letters blend printed and decorative elements, notably in 'Q', 'K', and 'L'.
	The lowercase 'f' has a mirrored bottom loop. Letters 'm', 'n', 'v', 'w', and
	especially 'z', begin with a curved entry stroke. The lowercase 'b' is
	distinguished by a knot, and interestingly, the 's' does not adopt a cursive
	form.

	<strong>Playwrite ID</strong> and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and
	Regular.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.

<h4>How to use the fonts in apps?</h4>

<p>
	The Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected
	writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually
	activated.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Microsoft Word:</strong> Go to Format in the Menu bar, select Font, and
	then the Advanced tab. Activate "Contextual Alternates" and "Kerning for fonts
	below" to apply these settings to all text sizes.
</p>
<p>
	Note: This font family doesn't include Bold or Italic styles, so please avoid
	applying them in text editors. If you use the common 'B' and 'I' buttons, you
	will automatically generate low-quality styles.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Google Docs and Slides:</strong> From the font selector drop-down, go to "More Fonts" 
    and search for the desired font name, in this case, "Playwrite ID", and click OK. 
    If some text is already selected, the font choice will apply.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>LibreOffice:</strong> In macOS, to select the different styles, go to
	Format in the Menu bar, select Character, and use the Typeface menu.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Adobe InDesign:</strong> Open the Paragraph Panel and select Adobe
	"World-Ready Paragraph Composer" from the contextual menu.

	"World-Ready Layout" from the contextual menu.
