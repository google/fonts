	The NCAA publishes the national curriculum, and issues of language are dealt
	with in the <em>“Primary Language Curriculum”</em>, which was last published in
	2019. This document is fully bilingual in English and Irish Gaelic. An
	additional guideline document for teachers called
	<em>”Primary Language Curriculum. Support Material for teachers. Writing”</em>,
	is also published by the NCAA. This devotes a full section to handwriting and
	suggests that children can be introduced to cursive writing as early as the
	junior infant level.
</p>
<p>
	In practice, however, each school can choose its own methods for teaching
	handwriting. Most teachers start with either print script (locally called
	“manuscript”) or precursive letters in junior and senior infant levels. From
	Class 1 onwards, students are taught to add exit strokes to letters and then
	connect them to achieve a cursive hand.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite Ireland is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to
	Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite Ireland characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This model showcases a sloped, continuous cursive style where uppercase letters
	connect to the following letter whenever possible. The letter 'H' is notable
	for its distinctive crossbar shape. Unlike other models in this category,
	lowercase letters have short extenders with loops but do not start with curved
	entry strokes. The construction of the bowls in 'b' and 'p' differs
	significantly from each other. The letter 'z' features a curved top and a
	looped descender.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
</p>

	writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually
	activated.
