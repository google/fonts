	According to the Indian National Curriculum Framework, students must be taught
	three languages, starting with their home tongue, and English can be among the
	languages they learn. Students should learn how to write in Grades 1 and 2, but
	the document does not specify any methods or models for teaching handwriting.
</p>
<p>
	The new NCERT textbooks for English are titled <em>Mridang</em>. The book for
	grade 1 teaches students print-style letterforms. No cursive writing
	instruction appears in this or the grade 2 textbook. However, NCERT’s previous
	English textbook series, called Marigold, focused on cursive writing in grade 2
	(7–8 years old) and showed samples in a style similar to one developed by
	Irish-born British diplomat, Vere Foster, in the second half of the nineteenth
	century. Further, handwriting textbooks produced by a major private publisher
	directly attribute the samples in their volumes to Foster’s model.

	Playwrite India is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to
	Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite India characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This slanted continuous cursive style features medium-length extenders and
	draws inspiration from Vere Foster's New Civil Service writing models. The
	script includes decorative capital letters, with 'A' and 'H' particularly
	notable for their elaborated crossbars. Lowercase letters are designed with
	loops on both ascenders and descenders, and several letters begin with curved
	entry strokes. The letter 'r' is distinguished by a knot, and 'q' is
	characterized by a short exit stroke in its descender.

	<strong>Playwrite IN</strong>, and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and
	Regular.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
</p>
