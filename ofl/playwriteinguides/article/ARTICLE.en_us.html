    Playwrite India Guides is a single-weight font designed to harmonize seamlessly with its companion, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+IN">Playwrite India</a>. This font includes guideline markers on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders, providing a visual aid for primary school children. These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	According to the Indian National Curriculum Framework, students must be taught
	three languages, starting with their home tongue, and English can be among the
	languages they learn. Students should learn how to write in Grades 1 and 2, but
	the document does not specify any methods or models for teaching handwriting.
</p>
<p>
	The new NCERT textbooks for English are titled <em>Mridang</em>. The book for
	grade 1 teaches students print-style letterforms. No cursive writing
	instruction appears in this or the grade 2 textbook. However, NCERT’s previous
	English textbook series, called Marigold, focused on cursive writing in grade 2
	(7–8 years old) and showed samples in a style similar to one developed by
	Irish-born British diplomat, Vere Foster, in the second half of the nineteenth
	century. Further, handwriting textbooks produced by a major private publisher
	directly attribute the samples in their volumes to Foster’s model.

<h4>Playwrite India Guides characteristics</h4>

<p>
	Guidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing. To create a versatile font for teachers designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. It replaces the glyph shape with the guidelines and matches the width of the letter space.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
