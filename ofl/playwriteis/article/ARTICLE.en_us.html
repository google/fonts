	The latest edition of the national curriculum, published in 2014, requires that
	at the end of fourth grade, students must “write all the letters, write clearly
	and understandably.” Handwriting teaching in Iceland happens during grades 1-3
	(6-9 years old), and books by the MMS adhere to a progressive system based on
	simplified modern italic styles.
</p>
<p>
	According to this system, students should first be introduced to the lowercase
	letters of <em>Grunnskrift</em> or the initial model. These are simplified and
	unconnected letters, slightly slanted and with exit strokes. This should be
	followed by uppercase letters of the same model. Finally, in the third grade
	(8-9 years old), students learn <em>Tengiskrift</em> or joined letters.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite Ísland is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to
	Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite Ísland characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This slanted modern cursive handwriting is crafted for high-speed writing and
	features print-style uppercase letters, with 'M' notably having splain legs.
	The lowercase letters are inspired by early Italic calligraphies, including the
	chancery style. Letters that end with a descender do not connect to the
	subsequent character, making this a semi-connected model. Both 'b' and 'p'
	feature closed bowls, while 'z' and 'r' are designed with an italic structure,
	stressing the script’s aesthetic and functional attributes.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
</p>

	writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually
	activated.
