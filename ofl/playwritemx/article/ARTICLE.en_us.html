Since the 1992 educational reform, the curricula for primary education no longer provide details about handwriting instruction or specific writing models. Moreover, it grants teachers the freedom to choose teaching methods for reading and writing instruction during the earliest stages. However, nearly all private schools and most public ones teach cursive writing — either alongside or sequentially — with print letters. But the resources they use for teaching cursive writing are privately acquired from publishing houses or created by teachers themselves.
</p>
<p>
In this context, local type designers have been commissioned to create typefaces that match the styles familiar to teachers. These typefaces are usually similar to North American penmanship models, more likely, a derivative from the National Commission of Free Textbooks workbooks dating back to the 1960s.

<h4>Playwrite México characteristics</h4>

<p>
This slanted continuous cursive closely mirrors North American models such as Palmer or Zaner-Bloser. The uppercase letters are cursive and include some complex shapes, notably in 'F', 'I', and 'G'. The lowercase letters feature medium-length extenders, with 'f' and 'q' displaying mirrored descender loops that add intricacy. The letter 'z' is designed with a curved top, while 'b', 'v', and 'w' incorporate knots, contributing to the overall ornate style. The construction of the letters is characterized by a slow and complex execution, emphasizing the deliberate and decorative nature of this handwriting style.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.
