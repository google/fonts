	Since the 1992 educational reform, the curricula for primary education no
	longer provide details about handwriting instruction or specific writing
	models. Moreover, it grants teachers the freedom to choose teaching methods for
	reading and writing instruction during the earliest stages. However, nearly all
	private schools and most public ones teach cursive writing — either alongside
	or sequentially — with print letters. But the resources they use for teaching
	cursive writing are privately acquired from publishing houses or created by
	teachers themselves.
</p>
<p>
	In this context, local type designers have been commissioned to create
	typefaces that match the styles familiar to teachers. These typefaces are
	usually similar to North American penmanship models, more likely, a derivative
	from the National Commission of Free Textbooks workbooks dating back to the
	1960s.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite México is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to
	Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite México characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This slanted continuous cursive closely mirrors North American models such as
	Palmer or Zaner-Bloser. The uppercase letters are cursive and include some
	complex shapes, notably in 'F', 'I', and 'G'. The lowercase letters feature
	medium-length extenders, with 'f' and 'q' displaying mirrored descender loops
	that add intricacy. The letter 'z' is designed with a curved top, while 'b',
	'v', and 'w' incorporate knots, contributing to the overall ornate style. The
	construction of the letters is characterized by a slow and complex execution,
	emphasizing the deliberate and decorative nature of this handwriting style.

<h4>Family name in font menus</h4>
<p>
	Playwrite México appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘MX’,
	<strong>Playwrite MX</strong>, and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and
	Regular.

	The download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts
	for each style.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.

	activated.
