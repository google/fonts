	In Nigeria, there is an emphasis on students receiving instruction in the
	language they hear and use every day. This poses a challenge in a country with
	limited resources and great linguistic diversity. Apart from four widely spoken
	languages — Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba and English — there are hundreds of regional
	languages as well as dialects. As a result, teacher training and educational
	resources are required for several languages.
</p>
<p>
	In the past, before the widespread use of computers, there was greater emphasis
	on handwriting. Today, while private schools with more resources may adopt
	foreign models like 
    <a href="https://primarium.info/handwriting-models/nelson-handwriting/">Nelson Handwriting</a>, 
    public schools face financial constraints, impacting their ability to prioritize 
    handwriting education. Given these circumstances, the handwriting style learned 
    by students is often influenced by the habits of their parents and teachers, 
    and they end up	mimicking what they see around them.

	Playwrite Nigeria Modern is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100)

<h4>Playwrite Nigeria Modern characteristics</h4>

<p>
	Following the tradition and current use of these booklets, Playwrite Nigeria
	Modern is a very slanted continuous cursive. Its lowercase letters have
	medium-length ascenders and descenders with loops that favor writing whole
	words without pen lifts. Based on the Palmer style, these loops are mirrored in
	the descending strokes of letters 'f' and 'q'. Some uppercase letters, such as
	the 'G', 'L', and 'Z', have decorative and complex cursive shapes.

	Playwrite Nigeria Modern appears in font menus with a two-letter country code
	‘NG’ and the word ‘Modern’, <strong>Playwrite NG Modern</strong>. It features four
	styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
