    Playwrite Nigeria Modern Guides is a single-weight font designed to harmonize seamlessly with its companion, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+NG+Modern">Playwrite Nigeria Modern</a>. This font includes guideline markers on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders, providing a visual aid for primary school children. These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.

	In Nigeria, there is an emphasis on students receiving instruction in the
	language they hear and use every day. This poses a challenge in a country with
	limited resources and great linguistic diversity. Apart from four widely spoken
	languages — Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba and English — there are hundreds of regional
	languages as well as dialects. As a result, teacher training and educational
	resources are required for several languages.
</p>
<p>
	In the past, before the widespread use of computers, there was greater emphasis
	on handwriting. Today, while private schools with more resources may adopt
	foreign models like 
    <a href="https://primarium.info/handwriting-models/nelson-handwriting/">Nelson Handwriting</a>, 
    public schools face financial constraints, impacting their ability to prioritize 
    handwriting education. Given these circumstances, the handwriting style learned 
    by students is often influenced by the habits of their parents and teachers, 
    and they end up	mimicking what they see around them.

<h4>Playwrite Nigeria Modern Guides characteristics</h4>

<p>
	Guidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing. To create a versatile font for teachers designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. It replaces the glyph shape with the guidelines and matches the width of the letter space.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
