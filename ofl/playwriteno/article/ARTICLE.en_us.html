<p>
	In Norway, the most prevalent form of handwriting in education is the
	<em>stavskrift</em>. It is an unlooped modern cursive style that borrows
	elements from continuous cursive writing. Students are taught uppercase and
	lowercase letters in <em>trykkskrift</em>, a simplified print script, in the
	first grade. In the middle of the second or beginning of the third grade, they
	are introduced to <em>stavskrift</em> and learn joining strokes between
	letters. This path may vary at the discretion of the teacher or the school, but
	in fourth grade, students are expected to have well-formed and legible
	handwriting with a certain degree of fluency.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite Norge is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to
	Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
