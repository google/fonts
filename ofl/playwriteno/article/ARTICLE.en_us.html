In Norway, the most prevalent form of handwriting in education is the <i>stavskrift</i>. It is an unlooped modern cursive style that borrows elements from continuous cursive writing. Students are taught uppercase and lowercase letters in <i>trykkskrift</i>, a simplified print script, in the first grade. In the middle of the second or beginning of the third grade, they are introduced to <i>stavskrift</i> and learn joining strokes between letters. This path may vary at the discretion of the teacher or the school, but in fourth grade, students are expected to have well-formed and legible handwriting with a certain degree of fluency.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide. This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student notes – that also includes emojis.
