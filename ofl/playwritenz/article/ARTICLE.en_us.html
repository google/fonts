	The style of handwriting currently taught in New Zealand is specified in
	<em>Teaching Handwriting</em>, a Ministry of Education publication, which was developed
	in response to teachers’ requests for guidance on the style of handwriting that
	should be taught in primary school. Teachers and schools usually create their
	own resources for handwriting instruction based on the style advocated in this
	document. It was first released in 1985 and again in digital format in 2008.
	Even though <em>Teaching Handwriting</em> outlines a progressive handwriting system that
	advances from simplified print script to cursive writing, sometimes teachers
	will not teach the latter if it is not practical given their students' learning
	levels and other curriculum needs.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite New Zealand is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to
	Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite New Zealand characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This modern cursive style is extremely fast and slanted, featuring simplified
	print-style uppercase letters. Notable are the open 'G' without a crossbar, a
	serifed 'I', and a 'Y' with a slanted stem. The lowercase letters are
	semi-connected, exhibiting a very fast and angular construction typical of
	modern cursive styles based on italic forms. The letter 'f' has a straight
	descender, and 'q' is distinguished by a short exit stroke that serves as a
	finial, enhancing the dynamic and streamlined appearance of the script.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
</p>

<h4>How to use the fonts in apps?</h4>

<p>
	The Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected
	writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually
	activated.
</p>
<p>
	Note: This font family doesn't include Bold or Italic styles, so please avoid
	applying them in text editors. If you use the common 'B' and 'I' buttons, you
	will automatically generate low-quality styles.
