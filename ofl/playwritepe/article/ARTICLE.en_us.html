	Due to the absence of handwriting education guidelines in the curriculum and no
	prescribed model, there is a great deal of diversity in the approaches to
	handwriting teaching. The most widespread method is to teach uppercase
	print-style letters first and connected cursive writing second. However, in
	some schools, students may start with cursive writing in the first grade
	itself, and in others, cursive writing is not taught at all. An important
	difference is seen in private schools, where handwriting may be taught using
	models imported from abroad. For instance, Spanish-English bilingual schools
	teach using the Sassoon model that was developed in England.

	Playwrite Perú is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to
	Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite Perú characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This upright continuous cursive handwriting model features medium-length
	ascenders and descenders. The capital letters are cursive and include a few
	complex shapes, notably in 'F', 'R', and 'O'. The letter 'G' is distinctive,
	appearing to be influenced by American styles rather than the traditional
	French vertical cursives. The lowercase letters have looped extenders and
	showcase a unique two-stroke construction of 'k'. The letter 'f' is
	characterized by a straight descender, while 'v' and 'w' are noted for their
	knots, adding to the distinctiveness of this cursive style.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
