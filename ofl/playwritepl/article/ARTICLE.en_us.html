	Poland’s <em>podstawa programowa</em>, or core curriculum, is published by the
	<em>Ministerstwo</em>, and available online, where it is continuously
	maintained. It mentions handwriting education very briefly, stating that the
	country’s goal is that students must learn to write by hand, legibly and
	fluently, in sentences and continuous text.
</p>
<p>
	In Poland, the prevalent handwriting education model is a loopless,
	fully-joined vertical cursive, and students are taught upper and lower cases
	simultaneously. Handwriting primers show samples of this style alongside
	instructions on how to draw them. When it comes to reading, students learn that
	through a serif typeface.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite Polska is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to
	Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite Polska characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This vertical continuous cursive features decorative uppercase letters, with
	'G', 'J', and 'Y' having descender loops that facilitate connections to
	subsequent letters. The lower cases have medium to long extenders and a
	restrained appearance. Ascenders are loopless, except for 'f', while 'g', 'j',
	and 'y' include looped descenders that complement the style of their
	corresponding uppercase forms. The letter 'k' is constructed in two strokes,
	and 'm', 'n', and 'r' start with curved entry strokes.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
</p>
