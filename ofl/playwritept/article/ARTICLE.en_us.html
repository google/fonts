	Even though writing may be introduced in preschool, systematic teaching of
	handwriting only happens in the 1° Cycle. Since schools have pedagogic autonomy
	in Portugal, there are differences in how handwriting is taught. However, it
	should be noted that they must meet the curriculum goals set out by the
	government and are subject to periodic external evaluations. Schools usually
	begin with <em>‘letra impressa’</em>, or print script letters, starting with
	capital letters for students aged 5–6 years old, before moving to a fully
	joined, vertical cursive writing, known as <em>‘escrita vertical’</em>. There
	are also some traditional schools that start handwriting teaching with
	<em>letra de mão/manuscrita</em>, or cursive letters from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite Portugal is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to
	Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite Portugal characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This upright continuous cursive model features decorative capital letters, with
	a notably distinctive 'Q' and an 'S' with a vertical stem. The lowercase
	letters are constructed slowly and carefully, displaying medium-length, looped
	ascenders and descenders. Letters 'm', 'n', 'v', and 'w' begin with curved
	entry strokes, while 'z' is characterized by a flat top. Additionally, the
	letter 'f' has a mirrored descender loop, and the letters 'o', 'v', 'w', and
	'z' include knots, enhancing the stylistic intricacy of this handwriting model.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
</p>
