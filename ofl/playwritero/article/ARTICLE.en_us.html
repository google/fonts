	The curriculum goals for <em>Comunicare în limba română</em>, or Communication
	in the Romanian language, place importance on teaching handwriting. Instruction
	happens during the early years of primary education, specifically in
	preparatory, first, and second grades. While schools and teachers have some
	flexibility in their methods, the instruction process, its stages, and writing
	models are widely standardized.
</p>
<p>
	Handwriting education begins in preparatory grade with a focus on print script
	alphabet, also known as <em>‘scris de tipar‘</em> or <em>‘litere bloc’</em>,
	and on development of communication skills. In first grade, students gradually
	transition to a cursive writing model called <em>‘litere de mână‘</em>. It is a
	continuous cursive style with a 18º slope, and its narrow proportions follow a
	grid.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite România is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to
	Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite România characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This slanted continuous cursive features a slow stroke speed and medium-length
	looped ascenders and descenders. The uppercase letters are decorative,
	highlighted by a straight spine in 'S' and a distinguishable shape in 'G'. Both
	capital and lowercase versions of 'X' and 'Z' include crossbars as a unifying
	stylistic element. The lowercase letters often incorporate knots, enhancing the
	complex appearance of the script. The letter 'f' has a loopless descender and
	connects to the next letter via its crossbar, while 'q' is notable for a short
	exit stroke in its descender.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
