<p>
	In 2020, the latest iteration of the <em>Rámcový Učebný Plán</em>, or Framework
	Curriculum, was published by the <em>Ministerstvo</em>. It provides a sample of
	fully-joined, cursive writing based on <em>‘Zjednodušená psací latinka‘</em>,
	or Simplified Latin script, which was ratified by the government of erstwhile
	Czechoslovakia in 1932. According to the curriculum, students must learn to
	write based on this model, following its letter shapes as well as slant.
</p>
<p>
	The Ministerstvo has been sharing this model with private publishers since
	1993, and in the absence of official digitization, publishers have produced
	their own versions for use in their textbooks. Until 2020, schools only
	received government funding for purchasing textbooks if they did so from
	state-verified publishers, though that is no longer the case.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite Slovensko is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to
	Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite Slovensko characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This slanted continuous cursive features medium to short extenders and is
	executed at a slow stroke speed. The capital letters maintain a cursive, mostly
	unadorned structure, with distinctive traits such as an unusually constructed
	'Q' and a vertical spine in 'S'. Lowercase letters have loops on extenders but
	lack knots, with the exception of the German-style 't'. Several lowercase
	letters begin with curved entry strokes. The letter 'z' is styled in a plain
	italic form and does not have a descender.

	<strong>Playwrite SK</strong>, and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and
	Regular.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
</p>

	writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually
	activated.
