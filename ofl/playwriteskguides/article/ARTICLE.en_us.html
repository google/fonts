    Playwrite Slovensko Guides is a single-weight font designed to harmonize seamlessly with its companion, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+SK">Playwrite Slovensko</a>. This font includes guideline markers on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders, providing a visual aid for primary school children. These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	The Ministerstvo has been sharing this model with private publishers since
	1993, and in the absence of official digitization, publishers have produced
	their own versions for use in their textbooks. Until 2020, schools only
	received government funding for purchasing textbooks if they did so from
	state-verified publishers, though that is no longer the case.

<h4>Playwrite Slovensko Guides characteristics</h4>

<p>
	Guidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing. To create a versatile font for teachers designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. It replaces the glyph shape with the guidelines and matches the width of the letter space.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
</p>
