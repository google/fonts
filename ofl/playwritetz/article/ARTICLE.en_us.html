	The primary school curriculum, published by the Ministry of Education, Science
	and Technology, and the Tanzania Institute of Education (TIE), was last updated
	in 2015. The first section, centered on the first two years of primary
	education (Standards 1 and 2) focuses on developing competencies in reading,
	writing and arithmetic. The TIE also publishes a syllabus that provides
	specific guidelines for the implementation of the curriculum. The syllabus
	states that students should learn print style letters first followed by cursive
	writing, but no models or samples are shown.
</p>
<p>
	In practice, Standard 1 students learn an almost upright precursive and
	progress to a fully-joined cursive from Standard 2 onwards. The primers
	available through the free online library services supply detailed samples and
	practice materials that are used in classrooms.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite Tanzania is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to
	Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite Tanzania characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This sloped continuous cursive style includes decorative capital letters. 'A'
	and 'H' feature looped crossbars, while 'G' has a cursive structure but lacks a
	descending stroke. 'M' and 'N' are constructed differently, with only one
	following a cursive format. The lowercase letters have looped ascenders and
	descenders. Curved entry strokes appear in 'm', 'n', and 'v', but are absent in
	'w'. The letter 'q' includes a mirrored loop in its descender.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
</p>

<h4>How to use the fonts in apps?</h4>

	writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually
	activated.
