	In the absence of a unified national approach, elementary education in the
	United States is supported by several private companies that espouse different
	approaches to teaching handwriting. According to American handwriting expert
	Kate Gladstone, it is difficult to confidently determine which handwriting
	models are most commonly taught in the country, but among the most widespread
	are Zaner-Bloser and D’Nealian, both following a
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+US+Trad">
    traditional style</a>, and Handwriting Without Tears. Two other programs featuring modern cursive
	models — Getty-Dubay and Barchowsky Fluent Hand — are rapidly gaining interest
	as writing models not only for children but also for adults seeking to improve
	their handwriting.

<p>
	Playwrite USA Modern is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to
	Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite USA Modern characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This style is a straightforward, completely upright modern cursive. The
	uppercase letters adopt a simplified print style, with notable features
	including a serif on 'I' and an 'M' with a raised center. The lowercase letters
	are semi-connected and designed with loopless, medium-length ascenders and
	descenders. Unusually for this style, the letters 'm', 'n', and 'r' begin with
	a curved entry stroke, which adds a subtle complexity to the otherwise
	streamlined appearance of the script.

	Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
</p>
