    Playwrite USA Modern Guides is a single-weight font designed to harmonize seamlessly with its companion, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+US+Modern">Playwrite USA Modern</a>. This font includes guideline markers on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders, providing a visual aid for primary school children. These guides help young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assist them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.

	In the absence of a unified national approach, elementary education in the
	United States is supported by several private companies that espouse different
	approaches to teaching handwriting. According to American handwriting expert
	Kate Gladstone, it is difficult to confidently determine which handwriting
	models are most commonly taught in the country, but among the most widespread
	are Zaner-Bloser and D’Nealian, both following a
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+US+Trad">
    traditional style</a>, and Handwriting Without Tears. Two other programs featuring modern cursive
	models — Getty-Dubay and Barchowsky Fluent Hand — are rapidly gaining interest
	as writing models not only for children but also for adults seeking to improve
	their handwriting.

<h4>Playwrite USA Modern Guides characteristics</h4>

<p>
	Guidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter spacing. To create a versatile font for teachers designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. It replaces the glyph shape with the guidelines and matches the width of the letter space.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
