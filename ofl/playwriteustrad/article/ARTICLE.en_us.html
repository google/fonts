	In the absence of a unified national approach, elementary education in the
	United States is supported by several private companies that espouse different
	approaches to teaching handwriting. According to American handwriting expert
	Kate Gladstone, it is difficult to confidently determine which handwriting
	models are most commonly taught in the country, but among the most widespread
	are Zaner-Bloser and D’Nealian, both following a traditional style, and
	Handwriting Without Tears. Two other programs featuring
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+US+Modern">
    modern cursive models</a>
	— Getty-Dubay and Barchowsky Fluent Hand — are rapidly gaining interest as
	writing models not only for children but also for adults seeking to improve
	their handwriting.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite USA Traditional is a variable font with a weight range from Thin
	(100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite USA Traditional characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This style follows the traditional American style of Zaner-Bloser and
	D'Nealian, featuring a slanted continuous cursive. Capital letters vary in
	appearance, with some like 'I', 'H', and 'G' being more decorative, and others
	such as 'A', 'N', and 'M' maintaining a cursive style. The construction of the
	letters appears fast and is complex in certain characters. Ascenders and
	descenders include loops to facilitate continuous writing, with mirrored loops
	in 'p' and 'q' enhancing the flow. Consistent with other English-speaking
	models, the entry strokes for 'v' and 'w' are distinctly different.

<p>
	Playwrite USA Traditional appears in font menus with a two-letter country code
	‘US’ and a the ‘Trad’ abbreviation, <strong>Playwrite US Trad</strong>. It features
	four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
</p>
