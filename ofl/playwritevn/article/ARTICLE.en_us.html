	In Vietnam, an official handwriting model for teaching in primary schools was
	adopted in 2002. It is called the <em>mẫu chữ thảo tiếng việt</em>, or
	<em>Vietnamese official cursive script</em>, and has been in use from academic
	year 2002-03 onwards. Based on this model, students learn to write in both
	upright and (optionally) sloped cursive letters, without ever being taught
	print letters. Nevertheless, they do practice drawing the basic strokes that
	make up letters in preparation. Handwriting education happens between Grades 1
	to 3, and while students are introduced to writing using a pencil, they
	graduate to writing with fountain pens while they are still in primary school.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite Việt Nam is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to
	Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite Việt Nam characteristics</h4>

<p>
	The model follows the structure and proportions of the upright, monolinear
	version of the Vietnamese official cursive script. These are the versions that
	are prioritized for teaching, while others may be introduced if the situation
	is conducive. The letter shapes derive from the French traditional vertical
	cursive writing, featuring long ascenders and descenders and round and fully
	joined lowercases. Letters 'b', 'r', 'v', and 'w' make use of knots to change
	the stroke direction, 'n' and 'm' have curved entry strokes and 'x' is created
	by means of two mirrored curves. Notable upper case features are the triangular
	yet decorative shapes of 'A', 'V' and 'W', and an 'S' with an upright spine.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.

	activated.
