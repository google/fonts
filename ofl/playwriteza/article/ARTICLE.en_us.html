	Through its website, the Department of Basic Education produces and distributes
	documents that outline curricula, educational goals and guidelines,
	implementation notes, and assessment policies. The Curriculum Assessment Policy
	Statements (CAPS) outlines the steps and objectives for handwriting instruction
	and specifies that students learn motor skills in Grade R, and unjoined upper
	and lowercase letters in Grade 1. They then gain speed and proficiency in Grade
	2, and proceed to cursive writing. The document does not, however, prescribe
	any handwriting models that should be used for teaching.
</p>
<p>
	Despite the absence of a recommended model, teachers, specialized publishers,
	and educational resource providers have converged on their choice of fonts for
	handwriting education. Geometric “ball and stick” letters are used for the
	first stage of instruction, and a very slanted continuous cursive style is used
	thereafter.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite South Africa is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100)
	to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite South Africa characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This continuous cursive features a gentle slope and a relatively slow pace of
	construction. The uppercase letters incorporate cursive elements, with looped
	descenders in 'G', 'J', 'Y', and 'Z', enhancing their fluidity. The lowercase
	letters have looped ascenders and descenders to support seamless connections
	between letters. Notably, this style does not include curved entry strokes in
	'm', 'n', 'v', and 'w', which is a departure from typical continuous cursives.
	However, it includes distinctly curved shapes in the letters 'x' and 'z',
	adding a dynamic element to the overall script.

	‘ZA’, <strong>Playwrite ZA</strong>, and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light,

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.
</p>

<h4>How to use the fonts in apps?</h4>

<p>
	The Playwrite font family uses complex OpenType features to generate connected
	writing. Some common applications require these features to be manually
	activated.
</p>
<p>
	Note: This font family doesn't include Bold or Italic styles, so please avoid
	applying them in text editors. If you use the common 'B' and 'I' buttons, you
	will automatically generate low-quality styles.
