<p>Inspired by the hand painted signs in supermarkets, and the roman structures
of the classical alphabets. Poetsen is a display font, but it's not just
intended to be used on big 'straight to the eye' titles. Since it has a large
x height, it can be used on short paragraphs in relatively small bodies of
text too.</p>
