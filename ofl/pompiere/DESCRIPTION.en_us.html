<p>Pompiere is a low contrast condensed sans serif font. 
However, unlike most sans it has very tall ascenders and a very small x-height. Pompiere is playful and even a little sweet. 
This font was inspired by a handmade sign seen outside of NYC firefighters Squad Co. 18 in the West Village of Manhattan. 
Because of its small x-height and modest weight, it will work best at medium to large sizes.</p>
