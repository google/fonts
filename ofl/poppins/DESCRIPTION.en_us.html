Geometric sans serif typefaces have always been popular, and with support for both the Devanagari and Latin writing systems, Poppins is an internationalist addition to the genre.
</p>
<p>
Many of the Latin glyphs (such as the ampersand) are more constructed and rationalist than is typical. 
The Devanagari design was particularly novel when it was first published in 2015, and was the first ever Devanagari typeface with a range of weights in this genre.
Just like the Latin, the Devanagari is based on pure geometry, particularly circles.
</p>
<p>
Each letterform is nearly monolinear, with optical corrections applied to stroke joints where necessary to maintain an even typographic color. 
The Devanagari base character height and the Latin ascender height are equal;
Latin capital letters are shorter than the Devanagari characters, and the Latin x-height is set rather high.

The project was developed by Indian Type Foundry (ITF).
The Devanagari was initially designed by Ninad Kale, while the Latin was initially designed by Jonny Pinhorn.
Following their principal phase of designing the first 5 styles, the typeface was later refined, and expanded to include multiple weights and italics, by the ITF studio team.
