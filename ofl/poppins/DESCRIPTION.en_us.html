Poppins is a clean-cut sans serif typeface. 
Each letterform is nearly monolinear, with optical corrections applied to stroke joints where necessary to maintain an even typographic color. 
Poppins has a range of weights that provide different variations and versatility, making it ideal for editorial and publishing or projects where a mix of weights can be used for a good effect.
