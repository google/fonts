Port Lligat Slab is a display typeface. It has a soft variation in strokes, condensed structure, vertical stress, and a well balanced groovy rhythm. 
It is particularly useful for both short text and headlines, but it is also has good on-screen readability. 
It is a super family designed with differing typographical categories matching the exact weight and width across the whole family. 
This allows for combined use in varied ways. The first releases are the regular Roman styles of the Sans and Slab families. 
The Slab matches exactly with the Sans but it has heavy slab serifs and rounded terminals.
