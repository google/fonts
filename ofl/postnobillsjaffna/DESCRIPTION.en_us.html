Post No Bills is a stencil font family,  supporting Latin, Sinhala and Tamil typefaces. Post No Bills Colombo includes Sinhala and Latin glyphs and Post No Bills Jaffna includes Latin and Tamil glyphs. This font family contains six weights from Extra Light to Extra Bold and gives designers flexibility clear and legible font that is ideal for headlines and short descriptors that require a dominant personality or tone of voice. The design aesthetic is based on letterforms that are commonly seen on railway cars and buses in Sri Lanka.

This font family was initially developed as a single weight uppercase only font for use of Stick No Bills Poster Gallery in Galle, Sri Lanka by Martyn Hodges. In February 2015, Stick No Bills gallery commissioned Mooniak to extend the Latin design. The font family was open sourced under Open Font License in 2016 and designers at MooniakTypes further refined the Latin design with a wider set of characters. In the second half of 2015, Google Fonts funded the project to extend the weights and language to support Sinhala and Tamil.
