FONTLOG for the Prata font

This file provides detailed information on the Prata 
font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Prata fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Prata is an elegant didone typeface with sharp features 
and organic teardrops. There is a certain tension in the 
contrast of its virile serifs and soft refined curves. 
Its triangular serifs complement and accent the thin 
strokes and the high contrast means it will work best 
in display sizes.

Designed by Ivan Petrov for Cyreal.

Prata is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and 
could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following Unicode
ranges: Latin-1
