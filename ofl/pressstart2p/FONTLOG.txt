FONTLOG for the Press Start 2P fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Press Start 2P Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Press Start 2P fonts
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Press Start 2P is a bitmap font based on the font design from 1980s Namco
arcade games. It works best at sizes of 8px, 16px and other multiples
of 8. Although the design of uppercase letters and digits dates
back to Atari's "Sprint" (1977), the specific glyph forms in this TrueType
conversion are based on those from "Return of Ishtar" (1986), one of the
first games to include and regularly use lowercase as well as uppercase
letters in its screen font.

Unlike the original font from the "Return of Ishtar" ROM, Press Start 2P
includes a wide variety of non-ASCII Unicode characters for pan-European
use, including Greek and Cyrillic. It could be expanded to support 
other scripts.
