<p>PT Root UI is a special part of the PT Root typeface family. It consists of four styles of normal proportions, from Light to Bold, intended for screen reading, interfaces, websites, as well as wayfinding systems. PT Root UI is a modern uniwidth sans serif whose individual character widths are constant across all weights. This is especially convenient for headers, menu bars and interface elements. It has a broad language support, including the Latin Extended and Cyrillic (including Cyrillic Asian), different sets of figures and currency signs, fractions and indices, as well as a number of wayfinding signs and alternative forms. </p><p>PT Root UI was designed by Vitaly Kuzmin and released by <a href=https://www.paratype.com>Paratype</a> in 2018.</p>
