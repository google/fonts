<p>PT Serif™ is the second pan-Cyrillic font family developed for the project “Public Types of the Russian Federation.” The first family of the project, PT Sans, was released in 2009.</p> <p>The fonts are released with a libre license and can be freely redistributed: The main aim of the project is to give possibility to the people of Russia to read and write in their native languages.</p> <p>The project is dedicated to the 300 year anniversary of the civil type invented by Peter the Great in 1708–1710. It was given financial support from the Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications.</p> <p>The fonts include standard Western, Central European and Cyrillic code pages, plus the characters of every title language in the Russian Federation. This makes them a unique and very important tool for modern digital communications.</p> <p>PT Serif is a transitional serif typeface with humanistic terminals. It is designed for use together with PT Sans, and is harmonized across metrics, proportions, weights and design.</p> <p>The family consists of six styles: regular and bold weights with corresponding italics form a standard font family for basic text setting; two caption styles in regular and italic are for use in small point sizes.</p> <p>Designed by Alexandra Korolkova, <a href="https://profiles.google.com/olga.umpeleva/about">Olga Umpeleva</a> and <a href="https://profiles.google.com/VladimirJeffYefimov/about">Vladimir Yefimov</a> and released by <a href=http://www.paratype.com/public/>ParaType</a> in 2010.</p>
