Puritan is a sans serif typeface made in response to Ben Weiner being influenced by the techniques for making grotesques, 
geometric and humanist sans serifs, and a typeface called Ehrhardt; a Monotype revival typeface based on a seventeenth century design by Miklos Kis. 
Puritan is legible in long body text and is suitable for newspapers, handbooks and articles.
