The thins are just a tad thiner than the thicks, almost monotone.</li> <li>Cupped, tapered stems that flows naturally into the serifs.</li> 
<li>Distinctive K, R and & tail.</li> <li>Cupped B, D, E, F, P, Q, R and T.</li> <li>The Q is a humble expression of admiration and 
gratitude for Doyald Young.</li> <li>Alternate M, Two W alternates .</li> <li>Narrow L, T for better fit.</li> <li>Almost flat top serif 
on the lowercases.</li> <li>Shoulders of the m and n rise above the serif.</li> <li>Serif-less bottom j and y.</li> </ul>
