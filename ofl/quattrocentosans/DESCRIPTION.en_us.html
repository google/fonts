<p>Quattrocento Sans is a classic, elegant and sober typeface family. Warm, readable and not intrusive. 
It's the perfect sans-serif companion for <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quattrocento">Quattrocento.</a></p> 
<p>The wide and open letterforms and large x-height make it very legible for body text at small sizes. 
All the tiny details that only shows up at bigger sizes make it also great for display use.
