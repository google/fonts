<h3>Giving African languages more Latin font choices</h3>
<h4>Questrial font provides pan-African Latin support</h4>
<img src="hero.png">
<p>Due to the scarcity of open source <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/font">fonts</a> for African languages, Google has released <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Questrial">Questrial</a>, offering more font choices for digital Africa.</p>
<p>During colonial times, European colonial powers in Africa made their languages (English, Dutch, French, Portuguese, Spanish, and more) the official languages in government, educational, cultural, and other state institutions in African countries. In post-colonial times, African countries aiming to maintain their native (non-colonial) languages face a major roadblock: not enough fonts with Pan-African support that provide all of the letters and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/diacritic_accent_marks">diacritics (or accent) marks</a> for the proper spelling of their languages.</p>
<p>Proper spelling isn’t just for school tests and national spelling competitions, it’s vital for communication and for language survival. Educational institutions and users need fonts that can show the orthography (proper spelling) for each language, so that students can learn how to write correctly. Otherwise, if pupils see the same word written in different ways, with different kinds of punctuation marks replacing diacritics, they may never learn the proper way to spell. Without standard spelling, students could confuse words that may look similar but have different meanings.</p>
<p>These are some examples of words in African languages with similar spellings and different meanings:</p>
<ul>
  <li>fɔ (to say) and fo (to greet) in Bambara</li>
  <li>motó (head) and mɔ́tɔ (fire) in Lingala</li>
  <li>ọ̀tá (enemy) and ota (bullet) in Yoruba</li>
</ul>
