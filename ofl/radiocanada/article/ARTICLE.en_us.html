  CBC/Radio-Canada is Canada's national public broadcaster. Their mandate is to inform, enlighten and entertain, in order to strengthen Canadian culture on radio, television and digital platforms.
</p>
<p>
  The Radio-Canada font was created in 2017 by Montreal-based designer and typographer Charles Daoud, in collaboration with Coppers and Brasses and Alexandre Saumier Demers. It was designed specifically for CBC/Radio-Canada as a brand unifying information
  font for all the Public Broadcaster’s platforms. Fittingly, for a Public Broadcaster, this is a peoples’ font and the humanistic style stands out with distinctive angles and subtle curves. Its x-height ensures excellent legibility and respects digital
  accessibility standards, making it very effective when used in continuous text.

  In 2018, the Radio-Canada font won three awards, in the Font Design category at Communication Arts Typography, Applied Arts Design Annual and at Grand Prix Grafika.

  Several optimizations saw the light of day in 2021. The number of supported languages has increased from 106 to 317 Latin languages. In 2022, Jacques Le Bailly (Baron von Fonthausen) expanded the font to include the support of Indigenous languages
