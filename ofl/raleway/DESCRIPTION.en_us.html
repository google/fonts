One word for Raleway? Elegant. It has unique characters like the criss-crossed w and an l with a tail. 
Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface family intended for headings and other large size usage
</p>
<p>
It is a display face and the download features both old style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than its neo-grotesque inspired default character set.

<p>
It also has a sister family, <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Raleway+Dots">Raleway Dots</a>.
