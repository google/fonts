A dotted version of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway">Raleway</a>, for posters and big headlines.

It is a display face and the downloadable font features both old-style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, as well as stylistic alternates that are inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than the default which is neo-grotesque.
