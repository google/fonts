Ramabhadra is a Telugu font developed for use in headlines, posters and at large sizes. 
The letterforms are very round and have a uniform thickness, and the terminals have a small temple shape that appear like a sans-serif design. 
This font includes unique Telugu conjunct letters.
Ramabhadra is named after the Telugu poet from the court of the king Krishnadevaraya, and was one of the Astadiggajalu (literally eight legends) there.
