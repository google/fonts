Intended for continuous reading on the web (longer articles
in online news, magazines, blogs), Rasa supports over 92
languages in Latin and 2 in Gujarati script (Gujarati and Kachchi). The fonts supports a wide array of basic and
compound syllables used in Gujarati.
A Latin-only version is available as <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Yrsa">Yrsa</a>.
In terms of glyphs included Rasa is a superset of Yrsa and includes the complete Latin, but in Rasa the Latin may be
adjusted to support the primary Gujarati font.

It is a deliberate experiment in remixing existing typefaces: 
The Latin part began with Eben Sorkin's <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather">Merriweather</a>.
The Gujarati began with David Březina’s <a href="https://www.rosettatype.com/Skolar#gujarati">Skolar Gujarati</a>.
