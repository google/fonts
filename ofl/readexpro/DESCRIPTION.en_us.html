Lexend is a <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?sort=date&query=lexend">family of variable fonts</a> designed by Bonnie Shaver-Troup, Thomas Jockin and Font Bureau. Applying the Shaver-Troup Individually Optimal Text Formation Factors, studies have found readers instantaneously improve their reading fluency.
</p>

<p>
    A Hyper Expansion axis was added to the family in October 2022. This axis increases inner and outter space of glyphs to adjust better to reader's individual comfort.
</p>

<p>
The fonts are based on the Quicksand project from Andrew Paglinawan. To contribute, see <a href="https://github.com/ThomasJockin/readexpro">github.com/ThomasJockin/readexpro</a>.
