Recursive is typographic palette for UI & code. It draws inspiration from single-stroke casual, a style of brush writing used in signpainting that is stylistically flexible and warmly energetic. Recursive adapts this aesthetic basis into an extensive variable font family, designed to excel in digital interactive environments, including data-rich user interfaces, technical documentation, and code editors.
