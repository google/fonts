Recursive is typographic palette for UI & code. It draws inspiration from single-stroke casual, a style of brush writing used in signpainting that is stylistically flexible and warmly energetic. Recursive adapts this aesthetic basis into an extensive variable font family, designed to excel in digital interactive environments, including data-rich user interfaces, technical documentation, and code editors.

Update, April 2021: the Google Fonts release of Recursive has been updated to incorporate various changes from its initial release. This includes fixes that correct printing issues, ensure consistent default line heights between styles on macOS, improve the handling of combining accents, add localization features for several languages, and resolve various other earlier issues.
