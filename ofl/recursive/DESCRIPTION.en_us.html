Recursive draws inspiration from single-stroke casual signpainting, a style of brush writing that is stylistically flexible and warmly energetic.
Adapting this aesthetic basis into an extensive type system, Recursive is designed to excel in digital interactive environments, including data-rich user interfaces, technical documentation, and code editors.

Recursive is a five-axis variable font, enabling you to choose from 64 predefined styles or dial in exactly what you want for each of its axes:
Monospace, Casual, Weight, Slant, and Cursive.
Taking full advantage of variable font technology, Recursive offers an unprecedented level of flexibility, all from a single font file.
