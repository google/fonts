<p>Red Hat is a family of typefaces produced in 2 optical sizes, in a range of weights with italics. The fonts were originally commissioned by Paula Scher, Pentagram and designed by Jeremy Mickel, MCKL for the new Red Hat identity.</p>

<p>Red Hat is a fresh take on the geometric sans genre, taking inspiration from a range of American sans serifs including Tempo and Highway Gothic. The Display styles are low contrast and spaced tightly, with a large x-height and open counters. The <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Red+Hat+Text">Text</a> styles have a slightly smaller x-height and narrower width for better legibility, are spaced more generously, and have thinned joins for better performance at small sizes. The two families can be used together seamlessly at a range of sizes.</p>

<p>As part of Red Hat’s commitment to open source software, the fonts are made available for use under the SIL Open Font License.</p>
