Red Hat is a family of typefaces produced in 2 optical sizes and this monospace style, each with a range of weights and with italics.
The fonts were originally commissioned by Paula Scher at Pentagram, and designed by Jeremy Mickel at MCKL for a new Red Hat brand identity.

The Red Hat typefaces are a fresh take on the geometric sans genre, taking inspiration from a range of American sans serifs including Tempo and Highway Gothic.
The <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Red+Hat+Display">Display</a> styles are low contrast and spaced tightly, with a large x-height and open counters.
The <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Red+Hat+Text">Text</a> styles have a slightly smaller x-height and narrower width for better legibility, are spaced more generously, and have thinned joins for better performance at small sizes.
The two families can be used together seamlessly at a range of sizes.
