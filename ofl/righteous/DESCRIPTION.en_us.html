<p>Righteous was initially inspired by the all capitals letterforms from the deco posters of Hungarian artist Robert Berény for Modiano. Grid based and geometric in execution, the letterforms are highly readable at a range of point sizes. Unlike that of the inspiration source, Righteous has a full lowercase to increase flexibility of use.</p>
