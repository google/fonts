Roboto has a dual nature. 
It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. 
At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. 
While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesnâ€™t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. 
This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.

<b>Updated April 2020:</b> Upgraded to a variable font with Weight and Width axes, that closely match the previous static fonts released as two families, this one and a sibling Roboto Condensed family.
