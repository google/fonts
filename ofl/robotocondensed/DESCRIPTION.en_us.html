<p>Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesnâ€™t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.</p>

<p>This is the Condensed family, which can be used alongside the normal Roboto family and the Roboto Slab family.</p>

<p>In August 2023, the family has been upgraded to a variable font.</p>
