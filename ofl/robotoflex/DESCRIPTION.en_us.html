    Roboto Flex upgrades Roboto so it becomes a more powerful typeface system. With Flex, you can customize Roboto to express and finesse your text in ways never before possible. Today, people are constantly switching between devices, resizing browsers, and
    spreading our viewports across multiple screens. So Google commissioned Font Bureau to re-imagine Roboto to “flex” along with us, with a special emphasis on large-screen capabilities. This was achieved by amplifying the original design to an extreme
    range of weights, grades, widths and optical sizes.

<p>
    The second benefit of Roboto Flex is the designer’s ability to fitness and fine-tune their designs with <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/parametric_axes">parametric axes</a>. Font Bureau first demonstrated the concept of parametric
    axes in <a href="https://www.axis-praxis.org/specimens/amstelvar">Amstelvar Alpha</a> (2017), to provide the ultimate in typographic flexibility. With early prototypes of Roboto Flex, Font Bureau demonstrated new solutions to the typographic problems
    that digital designers face. Demonstrations of high quality justification, better dark-mode typography and other uses of parametric axes are documented at <a href="https://variablefonts.typenetwork.com">variablefonts.typenetwork.com</a>

<p>
    The needs of developers, designers, and — of course — end-user readers were prioritized and aligned during development. To make Roboto Flex production-ready for all print and digital media, Font Bureau expanded the glyph set with careful planning and
    development, in partnership with script experts for Cyrillic and Greek. Rigorous testing of each glyph across every axis required new type design tools to be developed, like <a href="https://typetools.typenetwork.com/">typetools</a> and <a href="https://videoproof.typenetwork.com/">videoproof</a>,
    which can be used to explore the depth of the design.
</p>
<p>
    The final file size of the complete package is remarkably small, given the range of expressive styles now available. By driving variable fonts technology to its limits, it offers the most interesting and useful typographic tools for end users and designers.
    With a fully loaded Optical Size axis, Roboto Flex makes the layout of texts with deep hierarchies more straightforward and heightens the quality of every design that uses it.
