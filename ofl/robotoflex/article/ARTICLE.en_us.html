<p>There’s no perfect typeface that works for every size, every device, every application, every style, and every mood. But as the default for Android, with over 2.5 billion active users spanning over 190 countries, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto">Roboto</a> needs to be as flexible as possible.</p>
<p>Roboto is Google Fonts’ most popular download (you’re reading this blog post in Roboto). It was first released all the way back in 2011, but it’s been updated over the years to improve its language support and aesthetic qualities. The Roboto <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/superfamily">superfamily</a> has grown from the initial <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto">sans</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed">condensed</a> to span <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=roboto">Roboto Slab, Roboto Mono,</a> and—most recently—<a href="https://material.io/blog/roboto-serif">Roboto Serif</a>.</p>
<p>Now there’s another Roboto joining the lineup: Introducing Roboto Flex—a major upgrade to Roboto and Google Fonts’ biggest project to date. With a huge range of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/weight">weights</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/width">widths</a> across <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/optical_sizes">optical sizes</a>, plus additional capabilities for fine-tuning, Roboto Flex was designed by <a href="http://fontbureau.typenetwork.com/">Font Bureau</a> to be super scalable, adaptable, customizable, and optimizable.</p>
