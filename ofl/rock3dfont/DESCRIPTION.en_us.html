Design students produce fonts and graphic data based on the art drawn by people with disabilities. It is released as public data of Shibuya City official recognition. The adoption of wards and businesses has spread, making it a social action that leads to diversity understanding. The profits obtained from data sales are returned to the facilities for supporting people with disabilities.
