FONTLOG for the Ropa Sans font

This file provides detailed information on the Ropa Sans
font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Ropa Sans fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Ropa Sans was first designed as a homage to DIN and 
became a unique typeface during the work process.

The step to a remarkable Italic with its extreme ink-traps 
caused a hard change of nearly all shapes of the first 
slices of Roman. This process is still running and the Ropa
family will grow, for sure. Soon more at carrois.com

Ropa Sans was designed by Botio Nikoltchev

Ropa Sans is a Unicode typeface that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and 
could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1
