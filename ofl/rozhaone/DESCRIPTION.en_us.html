Rozha One is a very high contrast Open Source font, which currently offers support for the Devanagari and Latin scripts. 
Created primarily for display use, the extreme difference between its thick and thin strokes make it an excellent choice 
for large headlines and poster-sized graphics. 
</p>
<p>
The font’s Latin characters are drawn in a fat face ‘modern’ or ‘Didone’ style, similar to letters that were commonly used in 
19th century advertising posters in the West. 
It includes 1,095 glyphs, offering full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written with the Devanagari script.

<p>
When used in on-screen design environments, Rozha One should be used in very large pixel sizes. 
However in print, the design may be used in a broader range of sizes, perhaps even as small as at 16 or 18 points.
