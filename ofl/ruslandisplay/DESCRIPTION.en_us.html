The Ruslan Display font is based on a 1970s typeface made by Ukrainian designer Oleg Snarsky, which evokes the <em>ustav</em> and <em>semiustav</em> styles of the 11th–16th centuries, known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruthenians">Ruthenian</a> period.
This is featured in the signage of Kiev's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teremky_(Kyiv_Metro)">Teremky</a> metro station, and in a collection of Snarsky's typefaces in the book “Шрифты-алфавиты для рекламных и декоративно-оформительских работ“ published in 1979 and <a href="https://my.etnoua.info/novyny/knyha-shryfty-alfavity-osnarskyj-1979/">available online</a>.

It was digitized and extended with an original Latin complement by Russian designer Denis Masharov, in collaboration with Vladimir Rabdu, in 2011.
The name means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruslan_(given_name)">‘lion’</a>.

Suitable for lettering, Ruslan Display can also be used to set short texts and supports Latin and Cyrillic.
