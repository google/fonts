Sahitya is a Devanagari typeface family based on the Latin <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Alegreya">Alegreya</a> fonts. 
It was designed to match the style and feel of the original Latin characters. 
Juan Pablo del Peral designed the Latin, and led the design of the Devanagari with Sol Matas.
