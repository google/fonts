Saira is a sans serif system.
It features a huge range of weights and widths, ready for all kind of typographic challenges.

This is the Normal family, which is part of the superfamily along with

<a href="http://fonts.google.com/specimen/Saira+Extra+Condensed">Extra Condensed</a>,
each with 9 weights.

    Saira has been upgraded in 2020 to a variable font with axes for weight and width, adding expanded widths to the superfamily.
