Hear that?
That's the sound of tropical ocean breezes as they whistle gently through your laptop!
Grab a drink, a hammock under a swaying palm tree and let your hair down as your fingers gently caress the keyboard just like seaweed!
Enjoy Seaweed Script when a rustic tropical beachside script is called for and watch out for squid!
