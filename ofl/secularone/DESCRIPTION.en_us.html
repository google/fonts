Secular One is an original Hebrew and Latin humanistic sans serif typeface with a single weight.
At the time of publication (2016) there were not yet many Hebrew sans serif text typefaces. 
The designer Michal Sahar wanted to create a fresh, “easy going” design, simple but not neutral, friendly but not flattering or over-styled, straight but not too much… and highly readable in small sizes and long paragraphs. 
The Secular letterforms work equally well when used at large sizes where the delicate and eccentric elements are revealed, making it useful for branding purposes as well as typsetting long-form texts.

The Secular project is led by Michal Sahar, a type designer based in Tel Aviv, Israel.
