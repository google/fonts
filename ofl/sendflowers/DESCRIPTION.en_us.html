Send Flowers is a mono-weight script font with clean connecting strokes and a highly legible style. It has a cute look, but since it is a cursive it has a bit more sophistication that is appropriate for an older audience. It's old school juvenile, with a delicate appeal.

It comes with Latin Character sets including Western, Central, and Vietnamese language support.
