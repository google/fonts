<p>Sevillana is named after a folk music style widespread in Seville (Andalusia) in Spain. 
The typeface is inspired by the lettering of commemorative ceramic plates which can be seen on house walls in Andalusia.</p> 
<p>Those ceramic plates are handmade with each one unique on its own. Individual handwriting may vary but the style is always recognizable.</p> 
<p>Sevillana is a generalized character based on that diversity, a headline typeface that can be used in middle and large sizes, it can be used for restaurant menus, concert posters, different kinds of signage etc.</p>
