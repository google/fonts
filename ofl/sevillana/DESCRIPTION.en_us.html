<p>Sevillana is named after a folk music style widespread in Seville (Andalusia) in Spain. The typeface is inspired by the lettering of commemorative plates which can be seen on house walls in Andalusia.</p> <p>Those ceramic plates are handmade and each one is unique. Individual handwriting may vary but the style is always recognizable.</p> <p>Sevillana is a generalized character based on that diversity, a headline typeface that can be used in middle and large sizes, it can be used for restaurant menus, concert posters, different kinds of signage etc.</p> <p>Designed by <a href="https://profiles.google.com/olga.umpeleva/about">Olga Umpeleva</a> for Brownfox.
