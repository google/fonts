<p>Seymour One is derived from the earlier webfont 
<a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Sigmar+One">Sigmar One</a>,
but the forms have also been influenced by late nineteenth and early twentieth
century British sans-serif typefaces. The result is a display face that is
ideal for bold, unpretentious, and slightly playful display typography.
Seymour One is designed to be used conventionally but also as an 'all caps'
font.</p>

<p>Seymour One is designed to be used freely across the internet by web
browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.</p>

<p>The August 2023 update features a bigger glyphset and some minor aesthetic modifications.</p>
