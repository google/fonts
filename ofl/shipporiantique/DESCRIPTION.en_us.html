Shippori Antique follows long-established standards for dialogue in manga and was created to provide people who draw manga in Japan a beautiful antique font for free. The Kana follow an antique, Ming Dynasty style design based on Shippori Mincho with thick lines. The Latin was designed in an old sans-serif style. Finally, the Kanji was created by modifying the SIL licensed Genseki Gothic.
