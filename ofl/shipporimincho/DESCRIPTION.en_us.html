Shippori Mincho is a family intended for novel writers who are looking for a beautiful and free Mincho style family. It is based on The Tokyo Tsukiji Type Foundry No. 5 Mincho style, which has had a great influence on the style itself.

The Regular was originally designed for long-form text setting in novels and the ExtraBold was originally designed for titles and headlines. Eventually, it became a family of 5 weights.
