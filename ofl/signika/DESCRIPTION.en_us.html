Signika is a sans-serif with a gentle character, developed for wayfinding, signage, and other media where clarity of information is required. 
It has a low contrast and tall x-height to improve readability of texts in small sizes as well as in large distances from the reader. 
Being a typical signage typeface it is inspired by typefaces such as Ronnia, Meta, and Tahoma.

The typeface comes with a wide character set supporting Western European languages, Polish, and Czech. 
The figures are designed as tabular.
