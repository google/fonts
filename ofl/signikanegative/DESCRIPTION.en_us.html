<p>Signika is a sans-serif with a gentle character, developed for wayfinding, signage, and other media where clarity of information is required. It has a low contrast and tall x-height to improve readability of texts in small sizes as well as in large distances from the reader. Being a typical signage typeface it is inspired by typefaces such as Ronnia, Meta, and Tahoma.</p> <p>The typeface comes with a wide character set supporting Western European languages, Polish, and Czech. The figures are designed as tabular.</p> <p><strong>This is the <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Signika+Negative">alternative Negative version</a>, optimised to solve the effect of juxtaposed positive and negative text setting, where the text in negative tends to look thicker.</strong></p> <p>Small caps and small-cap figures will be published soon.</p>
