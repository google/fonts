    Signika variable font is a sans-serif with a gentle character, developed for wayfinding, signage, and other media where clarity of information is required.
    It has a low contrast and tall x-height to improve readability of texts in small sizes as well as in large distances from the reader.
    Being a typical signage typeface it is inspired by typefaces such as Ronnia, Meta, and Tahoma.

    The typeface comes with a wide character set supporting Western European languages, Polish, and Czech.
    The figures are designed as tabular.

    The Negative variable axis is optimized to solve for the optical effects of negative text setting, where the text set in negative (light text on a dark background) tends to look slightly thicker than positive text.
