# Six Caps

**Model**: Claude Opus 5.5
**Date**: 2026-10-05

Sources modernized 2026-10: the FontForge `.sfd` sources were converted to Glyphs
(`.glyphs`) and build with gftools-builder and fontc. The repository, commit and config
are in the `source { }` block of METADATA.pb.

## Initial state

Google Fonts shipped Six Caps built from FontForge `.sfd` sources in the family's
directory in the googlefontdirectory-hg monorepo
(https://github.com/googlefonts/googlefontdirectory-hg, `ofl/sixcaps` at commit
`52f780bc9d197280a9f430574e179a5f233c56b6`); it had no repository of its own. There was
no source that builds with fontc. The shipped binary carries FontForge's `FFTM` table,
so FontForge generated it.

## Actions taken

- The family's files were imported unmodified as the first commit of
  https://github.com/googlefonts/sixcaps.
- The `.sfd` needed no change: it was converted exactly as the designer left it.
- The `.sfd` was converted with babelfont-rs, using only filters that reproduce
  FontForge's own export, as the last commit.

## Final state

The source is https://github.com/googlefonts/sixcaps at `7f3c2a230b8f`. Builds with
gftools-builder (gftools-rust ade8776, fontc 1.0.0) and matches the binaries
google/fonts b5efa9c32e8f ships: 0 blocking rows under tools/table_gate.py, exactly the
release's codepoints, and functionally equivalent under tools/functional_gate.py (cmap,
shaping, rendering, names, line spacing, advances, GDEF), 1 style. Those tools:
https://github.com/felipesanches/gf-source-modernization at `541f72b`.

`7f3c2a230b8f` is the equivalence commit: its build is functionally equivalent to the
binaries Google Fonts ships. Source modernization adds no features. Where the shipped
binaries differ from the source, the difference is reproduced by a documented commit
before the conversion, never silently corrected. Any improvement is a later commit that
needs its own QA, and is left as future work for an onboarder to review in a font-update
PR.

## Original repository (dormant)

The source block this replaces, preserved for provenance:

    source {
      repository_url: "https://github.com/googlefonts/googlefontdirectory-hg"
      commit: "52f780bc9d197280a9f430574e179a5f233c56b6"
    }

## Previous investigation

## Six Caps -- Upstream Source Investigation

**Model**: Claude Opus 4.6

### Source Repository

Design sources were found in the **googlefontdirectory-hg** archive (Google Font Directory, Mercurial-era).

- **Repository**: googlefontdirectory-hg
- **Commit**: `52f780bc9d197280a9f430574e179a5f233c56b6`
- **Source path**: `sixcaps/src/`

### Source Files

The source directory contains: 1 SFD file (FontForge format).

The SFD format (FontForge) is not supported by gftools-builder. These sources are **not directly buildable** with the current open-source pipeline.

#### Key source files

- `SixCaps-TTF.sfd` (SFD, FontForge)

### Designer

Vernon Adams — newtypography.co.uk

### Repository Search

A search for canonical upstream repositories was conducted on GitHub. Searches for "sixcaps", "six caps font", and repositories by Vernon Adams returned only:

- **librefonts/sixcaps** — a librefonts mirror (excluded per policy).
- **google-fonts-bower/sixcaps-bower** — a deprecated bower packaging mirror.

No repository owned by Vernon Adams containing UFO or Glyphs sources was found. Vernon Adams passed away in 2014; his work is preserved via Google Fonts and associated archives.
