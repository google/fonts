<p>Sixtyfour and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Workbench">Workbench</a> fonts are inspired by the article Raster CRT Typography (According to DEC) by Norbert Landsteiner. They are a rework of some old pixel versions of the Commodore 64 and Amiga Workbench fonts the author created years ago.</p>

<p>The fonts now include two custom axes: <i>Scanlines</i>, which allows control of the height of the lines and, as a result of this, the amount of vertical space between the lines. And <i>Bleed</i> to change the amount of horizontal bleed of the pixels due to the phosphor latency found in CRT displays.</p>

<p>Due to this project's specificity and the fonts' historical origin, they only support a limited set of glyphs.</p>
