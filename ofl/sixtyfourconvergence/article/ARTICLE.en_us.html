  Sixtyfour Convergence is the COLRv1 companion of
  <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sixtyfour">Sixtyfour</a> a font
  inspired by the article Raster CRT Typography by Norbert Landsteiner, and is a
  rework of some old pixel versions of the Commodore 64.
</p>
<p>
  Due to this project's specificity and the fonts' historical origin, they only
  support a limited set of glyphs.

<h3>Homecomputer Fonts</h3>
<p>
  These fonts are inspired by the interface fonts of two classic 1980s
  computers, the Commodore C64 (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sixtyfour">Sixtyfour</a>) 
  and Amiga (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Workbench">Workbench</a>). 
  When Jens Kutilek adapted them to the variable font technology, 
  he did not just convert the pixel fonts, but tried to emulate the artifacts of 
  rendering letters on a CRT screen.
</p>
<p>
  The above fonts include two custom axes: <em>Scanlines</em>, which allows
  control of the height of the lines and, as a result of this, the amount of
  vertical space between the lines. And <em>Bleed</em> to change the amount of
  horizontal bleed of the pixels due to the phosphor latency found in CRT
  displays.

<h4>Sixtyfour Convergence</h4>
<p>
  Sixtyfour Convergence is Simon Cozens's COLRv1 take on Sixtyfour, which introduces 
  two additional new custom axes:
  <em>Horizontal Element Alignment</em> and
  <em>Vertical Element Alignment</em>. These axes allow the control of the position 
  of three painted layers, reproducing the control of the offset positions of the 
  red, green, and blue colors common on CRT monitors.
