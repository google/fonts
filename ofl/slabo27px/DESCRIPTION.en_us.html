<p>Slabo serif has a unified look and an assuredness about it, which could be attributed to its square appearance. 
Its distinctive feature has to be its size-specificity - how fine-tuned it is for use at either 27 pixels or 13pixels.
It is useful for general text applications and animated enough to serve display purposes.
The collection currently includes Slabo 27px, and <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Slabo+13px">Slabo 13px</a>. Each font in the collection is fine-tuned for use at the pixel size in its name.</p>
<p>The Slabo project is led by Tiro Typeworks, a type design foundry based in Canada. To contribute, see <a href="https://github.com/TiroTypeworks/Slabo">Slabo</a> on GitHub.</p>
