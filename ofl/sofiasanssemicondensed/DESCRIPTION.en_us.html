     Originaly designed as a typeface for the capital city of Bulgaria, Sofia Sans is a comprehensive type system in four widths (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sofia+Sans">Normal</a>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sofia+Sans+Semi+Condensed"> SemiCondensed</a>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sofia+Sans+Condensed">Condensed</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sofia+Sans+Extra+Condensed"> ExtraCondensed</a>) with extended coverage of the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic Scripts.

     Inspired by the early-twentieth-century so-called technical sans serifs typefaces with confident letterforms, a pronounced vertical impetus, and tense curves, Sofia Sans also has nice humanistic details and soft round corners that reminds print work with hot metal typesetting.

     With narrow proportions and a generous x-height, is a space-saving workhorse that would work well in very diverse environments. Sofia Sans is also a feature-rich OpenType family with a large character set including small caps, several figure styles, arrows, numerals in circles among others.
