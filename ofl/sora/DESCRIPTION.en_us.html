<p>Sora, meaning sky in Japanese, is a typeface family commissioned for the <a href="https://sora.org/" target="_blank">Sora</a> decentralized autonomous economy focused on empowering projects that benefit society. Soramitsu, the developer of Sora, is a Japanese technology company specializing in blockchain development and well-known for creating the first central bank digital currency.</p>
<p>Sora typeface was designed to capture Soramitsu's spirit and heritage resulting in a type family with cues of low-resolution aesthetics and early screen typography but without nostalgia, as every decision was considered towards the crisp digital environment of today. The particularly big x-height combined with evidently generous counters turns the family into a convenient tool for app and web interfaces, where clarity and effectiveness at any size is an imperative.</p>
