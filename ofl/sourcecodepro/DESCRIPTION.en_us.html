<p>Source Code Pro was designed by <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/type/font-designers/paul-hunt.html">Paul D. Hunt</a> as a companion to <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/source-sans-pro">Source Sans</a>. This complementary family was adapted from the Source design to create a monospaced version for coding applications. Source Code preserves the design features and vertical proportions of Source Sans, but alters the glyph widths so that they are uniform across all glyphs and weights. Although a regular weight will typically suffice for coding environments, Source Code is available in the same weight range as the corresponding Source Sans design.</p>

<p>Source Code Pro currently supports a wide range of languages using the Latin script. The latest release adds support for Greek and Cyrillic scripts (upright fonts only) and italics.</p>

<p>As an open source project, it is expected that incremental updates will be made over time to extend functionality. Future releases will add other features documented on the <a href="https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro">project page</a> hosted on GitHub. If you are interested in contributing to this open source project, please visit this <a href="https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro">project page</a> for information on how to become involved. Source Code Pro can be adapted and redistributed according to the terms of the <a href="http://wwwimages.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/products/type/pdfs/eulas/open-font-license.pdf">Open Font License (OFL) agreement</a>.</p>
