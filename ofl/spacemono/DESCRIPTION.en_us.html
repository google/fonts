Space Mono is an original fixed-width type family designed by Colophon Foundry for Google Design. 
It supports a Latin Extended glyph set, enabling typesetting for English and other Western European languages.

Developed for editorial use in headline and display typography, the letterforms infuse a geometric foundation 
and grotesque details with qualities often found in headline typefaces of the 1960s 
(See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microgramma_(typeface)">Microgramma</a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurostile">Eurostile</a>), 
many of which have since been co-opted by science fiction films, television, and literature.

Typographic features include old-style figures, superscript and subscript numerals, fractions, 
center-height and cap-height currency symbols, directional arrows, and multiple stylistic alternates.
