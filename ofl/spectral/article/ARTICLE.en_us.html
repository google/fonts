<h4>Screen-first typefaces</h4>
<p>The history of early digital typefaces, though still fairly recent, has already proven that typeface design doesn’t need to reinvent itself because of technical constraints. One only has to look back over the last 20 years to discover work that forged a viable path. Many early digital types (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinit%C3%A9_(typeface)">Trinité</a>, <a href="http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/demos-next/">Demos</a>, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=wdYmvQD5C8IC&pg=PT99#v=onepage&q&f=false">Colorado</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(typeface)">Georgia</a> for example) set a powerful example by being unobtrusive, transparent designs that rely on commonly accepted shapes, while remaining innovative and fit-for-purpose. These giants, on whose shoulders Spectral aspires to stand, form a solid set of accomplished, serious designs.</p>
