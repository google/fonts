<p>In geometry, a spirax is a curved line starting from a central point and
moving progressively away and around that point. The Spirax font is inspired
in this concept, trying to make you feel that you can go away from your
starting point but you’ll never be foreign. Spirax has a pronounced contrast
and original curves. It can be used for headlines and shorter texts. Spirax is
cute at all sizes!</p>
