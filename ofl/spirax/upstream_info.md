# Spirax

**Model**: Claude Opus 5.5
**Date**: 2026-10-05

Sources modernized 2026-10: the FontForge `.sfd` sources were converted to Glyphs
(`.glyphs`) and build with gftools-builder and fontc. The repository, commit and config
are in the `source { }` block of METADATA.pb.

## Initial state

Google Fonts shipped Spirax built from FontForge `.sfd` sources in the family's
directory in the googlefontdirectory-hg monorepo
(https://github.com/googlefonts/googlefontdirectory-hg, `ofl/spirax` at commit
`52f780bc9d197280a9f430574e179a5f233c56b6`); it had no repository of its own. There was
no source that builds with fontc. The shipped binary carries FontForge's `FFTM` table,
so FontForge generated it. The directory also holds FontLab `.vfb` files; the `.sfd` is
taken as the master because FontForge generated the shipped fonts and the build from the
`.sfd` is functionally equivalent to them.

## Actions taken

- The family's files were imported unmodified as the first commit of
  https://github.com/googlefonts/spirax.
- The `.sfd` needed no change: it was converted exactly as the designer left it.
- The `.sfd` was converted with babelfont-rs, using only filters that reproduce
  FontForge's own export, as the last commit.

## Final state

The source is https://github.com/googlefonts/spirax at `b651a4d37206`. Builds with
gftools-builder (gftools-rust ade8776, fontc 1.0.0) and matches the binaries
google/fonts b5efa9c32e8f ships: 0 blocking rows under tools/table_gate.py, exactly the
release's codepoints, and functionally equivalent under tools/functional_gate.py (cmap,
shaping, rendering, names, line spacing, advances, GDEF), 1 style. Those tools:
https://github.com/felipesanches/gf-source-modernization at `541f72b`.

`b651a4d37206` is the equivalence commit: its build is functionally equivalent to the
binaries Google Fonts ships. Source modernization adds no features. Where the shipped
binaries differ from the source, the difference is reproduced by a documented commit
before the conversion, never silently corrected. Any improvement is a later commit that
needs its own QA, and is left as future work for an onboarder to review in a font-update
PR.

## Original repository (dormant)

The source block this replaces, preserved for provenance:

    source {
      repository_url: "https://github.com/googlefonts/googlefontdirectory-hg"
      commit: "52f780bc9d197280a9f430574e179a5f233c56b6"
    }

### Source Repository

Design sources were found in the **googlefontdirectory-hg** archive (Google Font Directory, Mercurial-era).

- **Repository**: googlefontdirectory-hg
- **Commit**: `52f780bc9d197280a9f430574e179a5f233c56b6`
- **Source path**: `spirax/src/`

### Source Files

The source directory contains: 1 VFB file (FontLab, proprietary format); 1 SFD file (FontForge format); 1 compiled binary (OTF/TTF, not design sources).

Neither VFB (FontLab, proprietary) nor SFD (FontForge) formats are supported by gftools-builder. These sources are **not directly buildable** with the current open-source pipeline.

#### Key source files

- `Spirax-Regular.vfb` (VFB, proprietary)
- `Spirax-Regular-TTF.sfd` (SFD, FontForge)
- `Spirax-Regular.otf` (compiled binary)

### Research

Spirax was designed by Brenda Gallo and Gustavo Dipre, released in 2011.
The designer contact listed in METADATA.pb is Brenda Gallo
(gbrenda1987@gmail.com). Searches on GitHub for repositories maintained by
Brenda Gallo, Gustavo Dipre, or others for the Spirax typeface returned no
results. The font is only available in compiled TTF form with no open source
files found in any public repository.


### Notes

The designer listed in METADATA.pb is Brenda Gallo. Spirax is a display font
inspired by geometric spirals, featuring pronounced contrast and original
curves. It supports the Latin character set and is licensed under the SIL Open
Font License.
