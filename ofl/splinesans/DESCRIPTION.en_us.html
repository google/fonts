Spline Sans is a grotesque sans serif typeface family, purpose-built for UI interfaces, checkout processes, and paragraphs of text.
Space efficiency is accomplished by condensing traditional grotesque proportions.
The cool and restrained tone is accented with strategic "thorn" traps, which blossom into view when set at larger sizes.

Spline Sans is an original typeface initiated by the <a href="https://spline.design/">Spline Team</a>, and designed by Eben Sorkin and Mirko Velimirović, with project management by Faride Mereb, testing and design feedback by Gonçalo Teixeira, and concept by Alejandro León.

Spline Sans supports an extended Latin glyph set, enabling the typesetting of English, Western, Central and Eastern European languages.
