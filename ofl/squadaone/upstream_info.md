# Squada One

**Model**: Claude Opus 5.5
**Date**: 2026-10-05

Sources modernized 2026-10: the FontForge `.sfd` sources were converted to Glyphs
(`.glyphs`) and build with gftools-builder and fontc. The repository, commit and config
are in the `source { }` block of METADATA.pb.

## Initial state

Google Fonts shipped Squada One built from FontForge `.sfd` sources in the family's
directory in the googlefontdirectory-hg monorepo
(https://github.com/googlefonts/googlefontdirectory-hg, `ofl/squadaone` at commit
`52f780bc9d197280a9f430574e179a5f233c56b6`); it had no repository of its own. There was
no source that builds with fontc. The shipped binary carries FontForge's `FFTM` table,
so FontForge generated it. The directory also holds FontLab `.vfb` files; the `.sfd` is
taken as the master because FontForge generated the shipped fonts and the build from the
`.sfd` is functionally equivalent to them.

## Actions taken

- The family's files were imported unmodified as the first commit of
  https://github.com/googlefonts/squadaone.
- Each change to the `.sfd` before conversion is its own commit: Name SquadaOne-Regular
  as the release does.
- The `.sfd` was converted with babelfont-rs, using only filters that reproduce
  FontForge's own export, as the last commit.

## Final state

The source is https://github.com/googlefonts/squadaone at `6d57ce4c8435`. Builds with
gftools-builder (gftools-rust ade8776, fontc 1.0.0) and matches the binaries
google/fonts b5efa9c32e8f ships: 0 blocking rows under tools/table_gate.py, exactly the
release's codepoints, and functionally equivalent under tools/functional_gate.py (cmap,
shaping, rendering, names, line spacing, advances, GDEF), 1 style. Those tools,
including this family's plan `plans/squadaone.json`:
https://github.com/felipesanches/gf-source-modernization at `541f72b`.

`6d57ce4c8435` is the equivalence commit: its build is functionally equivalent to the
binaries Google Fonts ships. Source modernization adds no features. Where the shipped
binaries differ from the source, the difference is reproduced by a documented commit
before the conversion, never silently corrected. Any improvement is a later commit that
needs its own QA, and is left as future work for an onboarder to review in a font-update
PR.

## Original repository (dormant)

The source block this replaces, preserved for provenance:

    source {
      repository_url: "https://github.com/googlefonts/googlefontdirectory-hg"
      commit: "52f780bc9d197280a9f430574e179a5f233c56b6"
    }

### Source Repository

Design sources were found in the **googlefontdirectory-hg** archive (Google Font Directory, Mercurial-era).

- **Repository**: googlefontdirectory-hg
- **Commit**: `52f780bc9d197280a9f430574e179a5f233c56b6`
- **Source path**: `squadaone/src/`

### Source Files

The source directory contains: 1 VFB file (FontLab, proprietary format); 1 SFD file (FontForge format); 1 compiled binary (OTF/TTF, not design sources).

Neither VFB (FontLab, proprietary) nor SFD (FontForge) formats are supported by gftools-builder. These sources are **not directly buildable** with the current open-source pipeline.

#### Key source files

- `SquadaOne-Regular.vfb` (VFB, proprietary)
- `SquadaOne-Regular-TTF.sfd` (SFD, FontForge)
- `SquadaOne-Regular.otf` (compiled binary)

### Research

Squada One was designed by Joe Prince for Admix Designs
(http://www.admixdesigns.com, joe@admixdesigns.com) and released in 2011.
Searches on GitHub for repositories by Joe Prince, Admix Designs, or related
names returned no relevant results. The GitHub user `joeprince` exists but had
only an unrelated repository (`k-r`). No Admix Designs GitHub organization was
found.


### Notes

The designer listed in METADATA.pb is Joe Prince. Squada One is described as
a bold, geometric, condensed display typeface suitable for use at any size.
