Sriracha is a new Thai + Latin handwriting typeface, with an informal loopless + sans serif design. 
It has 2 stylistic set alternate glyph designs and intelligent OpenType features to recreate the impression of handwriting.

Thanks to Pablo Impallari for the initial OpenType handwriting feature development.
