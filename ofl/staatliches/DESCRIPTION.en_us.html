<p><i>Staatliches</i> is a clean cut display face with charmingly unconventional proportions. The alphabet was designed in response to Herbert Bayerâ€™s title lettering on the cover of the first Bauhaus exhibition <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/7567?artist_id=399&locale=en&page=1&sov_referrer=artist">catalogue</a>, which was published in 1923. It features full sets of capitals, numbers, punctuation, and symbols, in addition to alternate widths, discretionary ligatures, and common Latin accents.</p>
