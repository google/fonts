# Stalinist One

**Model**: Claude Opus 5.5
**Date**: 2026-11-04

Sources modernized 2026-11: the only published source of this family, a FontLab `.vfb`,
is an import of the fonts Google Fonts ships, so those fonts were converted to Glyphs
(`.glyphs`) sources, which build with gftools-builder and fontc. The repository, commit
and config are in the `source { }` block of METADATA.pb.

## Initial state

Google Fonts shipped Stalinist One (google/fonts at commit `2fe1e8c6b137`). Its only
published source is a FontLab import of the shipped fonts, not a design source (listed
under "Earlier sources"; Simon on google/fonts#10490: "batch-converted from the binary
files"), and it could not be built with fontc.

## Actions taken

- The fonts Google Fonts ships were imported unmodified as the first commit of
  https://github.com/googlefonts/stalinistone.
- The Unified Font Repository template was adopted in its own commit; the README records
  the provenance and the known differences below.
- The conversion to `.glyphs` is the last change. Converted from
  StalinistOne-Regular.ttf, the font Google Fonts ships, with babelfont 26fdcfa
  (felipesanches/babelfont-rs branch 2026-11-02: simoncozens/babelfont-rs main plus the
  name changes proposed to it (#117, typographic-family-names)): its TTF reader, no
  filters. sources/config.yaml: productionNames: false

## Final state

The source is https://github.com/googlefonts/stalinistone at `3ca514581dd3`. Builds with
gftools-builder (gftools-rust 1e638bd, fontc 1.0.0) and matches the binaries
google/fonts 2eb0b48d5f76 ships: 0 blocking rows under tools/table_gate.py, exactly the
release's codepoints, and functionally equivalent under tools/functional_gate.py (cmap,
shaping, rendering, names, line spacing, advances, GDEF), 1 style. Those tools,
including this family's plan `plans/stalinistone.json`:
https://github.com/felipesanches/gf-source-modernization at `65a4e2b`.

`3ca514581dd3` is the equivalence commit: its build is functionally equivalent to the
binaries Google Fonts ships. Source modernization adds no features. Any improvement is a
later commit that needs its own QA, and is left as future work for an onboarder to
review in a font-update PR.

## Known differences from the released fonts

Reviewed and deliberately left as they are; the repository's README lists them too:

- The released font is hinted (TrueType instructions). These sources carry no TrueType
  instructions, so the build is hinted by ttfautohint: the outlines, spacing and layout
  are the release's, its rendering at small sizes under a TrueType interpreter is not.
  Hinting is not compared by the gates.

## Earlier sources

Other copies of this family, kept on record; none of them is a design source:

- https://github.com/googlefonts/googlefontdirectory-hg at
  52f780bc9d197280a9f430574e179a5f233c56b6: src/StalinistOne-Regular-TTF.vfb, a FontLab
  import of the shipped font, not a source: Simon on google/fonts#10490
  ("batch-converted from the binary files").

## Original repository (dormant)

The source block this replaces, preserved for provenance:

    source {
      repository_url: "https://github.com/googlefonts/googlefontdirectory-hg"
      commit: "52f780bc9d197280a9f430574e179a5f233c56b6"
    }

## Previous investigation

**Model**: Claude Opus 4.6

### Source Repository

Design sources were found in the **googlefontdirectory-hg** archive (Google Font Directory, Mercurial-era).

- **Repository**: googlefontdirectory-hg
- **Commit**: `52f780bc9d197280a9f430574e179a5f233c56b6`
- **Source path**: `stalinistone/src/`

### Source Files

The source directory contains: 1 VFB file (FontLab, proprietary format).

The VFB format is proprietary (FontLab) and cannot be built with gftools-builder. These sources are **not directly buildable** with the current open-source pipeline.

#### Key source files

- `StalinistOne-Regular-TTF.vfb` (VFB, proprietary)

### Research

Stalinist One was designed collaboratively by Alexey Maslov and Jovanny Lemonad
(lemonad@jovanny.ru). The font was released in 2009-2011 and updated in 2015.
Searches on GitHub for repositories by these designers or under the font name
returned no results. No GitHub accounts for Alexey Maslov or Jovanny Lemonad
(lemonad@jovanny.ru) were found to have public font source repositories.


### Notes

The designer listed in METADATA.pb is Alexey Maslov, Jovanny Lemonad. Stalinist
One is described as a post-apocalyptic display typeface designed in Moscow. It
supports Cyrillic, Latin, and Latin Extended character sets and is licensed
under the SIL Open Font License.
