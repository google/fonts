<p>Stint Ultra Expanded is an ultra-expanded square serif typestyle, that was developed based on the letterforms of the 
<a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Syncopate">Syncopate Family</a>. 
Syncopate boasts extra wide unicase forms, and Stint Ultra Expanded follows this direction, 
featuring wide letterforms of both the capital and lowercase varieties. 
This is the opposite of the <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Stint+Ultra+Condensed">Stint Ultra Condensed</a> typestyle.</p> 
<p>Highly legible and matching the Syncopate family width, Stint Ultra Expanded is a perfect font for powerful headlines and copy 
when realty on websites and designs is less of a concern.</p>
