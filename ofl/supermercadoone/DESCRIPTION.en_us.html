Supermercado One is a low contrast semi geometric typeface inspired by naive industrial letters.
It is not a typical mechanical sans because it incorporates unexpected swashes, especially in its capitals, and is surprisingly versatile. 
While distinctive when set at large sizes, it can also work at fairly small sizes and in blocks of text.
