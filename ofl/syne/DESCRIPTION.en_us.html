<p>The Syne family was originally designed in 2017 for the Art Center "Synesthésie", based in Saint-Denis — a suburb of Paris. The Art Center aims to gather diverse artistic personalities in order to create new and enriching situations. Based on that idea, Syne is an exploration of atypical associations of weights and styles.</p>

<p>Syne Regular is the starting point of the family. It is quite an archetypal geometric sans-serif, giving the art center a practical asset for their daily use. When getting bolder, the typeface also gets wider, forcing radical graphic design choices.</p>

<p>Syne was conceptualized by Bonjour Monde and designed by Lucas Descroix with the help of Arman Mohtadji. To contribute, see <a href="https://gitlab.com/bonjour-monde/fonderie/syne-typeface">gitlab.com/bonjour-monde/fonderie/syne-typeface</a></p>
