<p>Syne was originally designed in 2017 for the art center Synesthésie, based in Saint-Denis in the suburb of Paris, France. Closely based on the art center’s team’s will to gather diverse artistic personalities to create fresh and enriching situations, the type family is an exploration into atypical associations in weights and styles. Syne Regular, starting point of the family, is a rather archetypal geometric sans, giving the art center a practical asset for their daily use. When getting bolder the type also gains in width, forcing radical graphic design choices. The Italic shares its x-height and optical weight with the Regular, but draws its structures in flourished Renaissance models and its peculiar flavour in the acceptance of a certain roughness in vectors, through the unusual exercise of trackpad-calligraphy. Latest addition to the family, the Mono is another take on letting go of control. Based on the Regular style, it has been processed by Bonjour Monde’s DataFace tool, automatically switching on-curve points into off-curve ones and vice-versa. Overall Syne is an assemblage of personalities — they can live all together, in small groups or on their own and will always create a surprising and distinctive visual situation.</p>

<p>Syne (v1.0) was initially released in the summer of 2018 and was updated a year later (v1.2) with refined countours and spacing, additional alternates and a variable font. A new update (v2.0) was made in 2020 to be distributed by Google Fonts.</p>

<p>Syne was imagined by Bonjour Monde and designed by Lucas Descroix with the help of Arman Mohtadji. To contribute, see <a href="https://gitlab.com/bonjour-monde/fonderie/syne-typeface">https://gitlab.com/bonjour-monde/fonderie/syne-typeface</a></p>
