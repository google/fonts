<p>Syne was originally designed in 2017 for the art center Synesth√©sie, based in Saint-Denis, a suburb of Paris.</p>

<p>Syne (v1.0) was initially released in the summer of 2018 and was updated a year later (v1.2) with refined countours and spacing, additional alternates and a variable font. A new update (v2.0) was made in 2020 to be distributed by Google Fonts.</p>

<p>Syne was imagined by Bonjour Monde and designed by Lucas Descroix with the help of Arman Mohtadji. To contribute, see <a href="https://gitlab.com/bonjour-monde/fonderie/syne-typeface">https://gitlab.com/bonjour-monde/fonderie/syne-typeface</a></p>
