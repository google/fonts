    Tac One is a single-weight, bold Sans Serif inspired by the wordmark of one of the most significant festivals in Africa's post-colonial history, Festac '77. It's a revival that expands upon the six lowercase letters, single quotes and number 7 in the wordmark, resulting in a full Google SSA character set. Tac is the second project from Afrotype.
