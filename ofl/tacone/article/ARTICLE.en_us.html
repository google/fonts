Tac One is the initial release of a single style, bold weight, sans serif typeface project that is inspired by the wordmark of one of the most significant festivals in Africa's post-colonial history, Festac '77. 
As a inspired revival, it expands upon the six lowercase letters, single quotes and numeral 7 in the festival's wordmark, and the result is a contemporary font with comprehensive language support for all African languages that are commonly written with the Latin writing system.
Tac is the second project from Afrotype.
