Tajawal is a distinctive low contrast Arabic and sans serif Latin typeface family in 7 weights that was created and designed by Boutrosâ„¢ 
following a modern geometric style while still respecting the calligraphy rules of the Arabic script.
Its fluid geometry makes it the perfect choice to use in both print and web applications, and alongside other Latin typefaces.
