<p>TASA Explorer is part of the TASA Typeface Collection—two typefaces originally commissioned by the <a href="https://www.tasa.org.tw/en-US">Taiwan Space Agency (TASA)</a> as part of its institutional rebrand, and released under the SIL Open Font License. It is accompanied by its sibling typeface, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/TASA+Orbiter">TASA Orbiter</a>.</p>

<p>TASA Explorer is a geometric sans-serif designed to embody the adventurous spirit of space exploration. Its vertically cut terminals and sharp- angled corners lend a bold, assertive presence that commands attention. Subtle contrast between thick and thin strokes introduces visual rhythm, preventing the geometric structure from feeling static or rigid.</p>

<p>The original TASA typefaces (v1) were designed by Local Remote between 2022 and 2023. TASA Explorer (v1) featured five weights and was designed exclusively for display use. With an extremely large x-height and minimal optical corrections, it was optimized for high-impact performance at large sizes.</p>

<p>In 2025, both typefaces were updated by Weizhong Zhang. The focus of the update was to preserve their core design characteristics while improving drawing precision and readability. TASA Explorer (v2) introduces a slightly reduced x-height, smoother letterforms, and more relaxed spacing, resulting in a more even texture across text blocks. It is now suitable for both display and text applications. The fonts now support the Google Fonts Core Latin character set, along with additional glyphs for Taiwanese Romanizations (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A2i-u%C3%A2n_L%C3%B4-m%C3%A1-j%C4%AB_Phing-im_Hong-%C3%A0n">Tâi-lô</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB">POJ</a>).</p>
