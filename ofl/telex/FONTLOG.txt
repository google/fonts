FONTLOG for Telex font

This file provides detailed information on the Telex font
Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Telex
font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Telex is a humanist sans serif conceived to be a web font with 
nice legibility at normal text sizes. Originally based on grid 
fitting shapes it became a multi-purpose typeface with low 
contrast, open counter forms, wide proportions and a touch 
of freshness.

It is ideal for paragraph text on websites (blogs, news) 
and also for printed text.
