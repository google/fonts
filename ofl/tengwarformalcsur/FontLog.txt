1 About Tengwar Formal CSUR
==============================

1.1 Purpose

Tengwar Formal CSUR is a Tengwar font based on Michał Nowakowski's
Tengwar Formal font. The difference from Michał's font is that it encodes
the Tengwar in the Personal Use Area of Unicode. Like this, it does not
violate the Unicode standard. Also, it uses the smart font technologies
Graphite and AAT for correct placement of tehtar and for font options.

Tengwar Formal CSUR is an example of how a Tengwar font with a legacy
Dan-Smithian encoding can be converted into a Tengwar font with a Personal
Use Area encoding.

For more information, see:
http://freetengwar.sourceforge.net/formal.html


1.2 Installation

Tengwar Formal CSUR can be used in any modern operating system, even if
the smart tehtar placement may not work.

This document explains how to install it on some common systems.


	* Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP; Vista

		Vista:
			1) From the Start menu, open Control Panels
			2) Drag-n-drop font files onto Fonts control panel
			You may get a dialog saying
				"Windows needs your permission to continue"
			a) Click Continue

		95/98/NT:
			The font installation is similar to Vista.

			In order to use OpenType, users of Windows 95, 98 and NT 4.0
			can install Adobe's 'Type Manager Light'.  It is available
			for download without cost from Adobe's web site.

			Otherwise, use the TrueType versions.

	* Mac OS X

		Installing on Mac OS X consists of moving the .ttf files to
		either /Library/Fonts/  or  ~/Library/Fonts/ depending on
		whether they should be available to all users on your system or
		just to yourself.

	* UNIX/GNU/Linux/BSD Systems

		KDE local installation:
			Users of KDE can install .ttf files on a per-user basis
			using the KDE Control Center module "kcmfontinst", which
			may appear in the menu as

				Settings -> System Administration -> Font Installer

			This is especially helpful for developers and testers.


		Generic X-windows:

			1) Unpack TrueType fonts into a suitable directory, e.g.
			/usr/local/share/fonts/default/TrueType/

			2) If you have chosen any other directory, make sure the
			directory you used to install the fonts is listed in the
			path searched by the X Font Server by editing the config
			file in /etc/X11/.

			In some systems, you list the directory in the item
			"catalogue=" in the file /etc/X11/fs/config.

			3) Run ttmkfdir in the directory where you unpacked the
			fonts.


1.3 Files

TengwarFormalCSUR.ttf
    This is the font.

TengwarFormal12c.sfd
TengwarFormalA12c.sfd
    These are Michał Nowakowski's original Tengwar Formal source files.
    They have been made with FontForge, the free outline font editor:
    http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/

TengwarFormalCSUR-addchar.sfd
    This is a source file that contains new glyphs that were not part of
    Michał's original font.

dansmith2unicode.py
    This is a FontForge script by Johan Winge that will merge the three
    above source files. You can run it with the following command:

        fontforge -script dansmith2unicode.py

    This creates the new font where the tengwar are encoded in the Personal
    Use Area of Unicode, and a GDH file that contains all glyph names of that
    font:

        TengwarFormalCSUR.sfd
        TengwarFormalCSUR_dumb.ttf
        TengwarFormalCSUR.gdh

TengwarFormalCSUR.mif
    This is a Morph Input File that is used to add AAT information to
    TengwarFormalCSUR. It requires Apple's font tools:
    http://developer.apple.com/fonts/download/

        ftxenhancer -m TengwarFormalCSUR.mif TengwarFormalCSUR_dumb.ttf

TengwarFormalCSUR.gdl
    This is a Graphite Description Language file that is used to add
    Graphite information to TengwarFormalCSUR. It requires a Graphite
    Compiler:
    http://scripts.sil.org/GraphiteCompilerDownload

        grcompiler TengwarFormalCSUR.gdl TengwarFormalCSUR_dumb.ttf TengwarFormalCSUR.ttf

compile.sh
    This is a small shell script that automates the generation of
    TengwarFormalCSUR with dansmith2unicode.py, TengwarFormalCSUR.mif and
    TengwarFormalCSUR.gdl:

        ./compile.sh


2 Original FontLog of Tengwar Formal
====================================

1.1  FONTLOG for Tengwar Formal

This file provides detailed information on the Tengwar Formal font software.
This information should be distributed along with the Tengwar Formal fonts and
any derivative works.

1.2  Basic Font Information

The Tengwar alphabet was originally designed by J.R.R Tolkien,
and the design was first published on paper in Appendix E in the
first edition of the "Lord of the Rings".

The Tengwar Formal Font was first made by Michał Nowakowski in 2002.
Its glyphs' forms are to resemble one of Tolkien's original
designs, namely the "formal bookhand" Tengwar style. Please do not
confuse this style with Latin "formal scripts".

The fonts are licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
This license is provided in a separate file, LICENSE, supplied with
the fonts, and is also available with a FAQ at: http://scripts.sil.org/OFL

Tengwar Formal keyboard layout is almost identical to standard Tengwar
fonts keymapping by Dan Smith. Tengwar Formal A keyboard layout will
probably vary between versions, as it is still in development.
The details are described in the Keymapping.pdf file, included with
the fonts, and available as a standalone file at:
http://tengwarformal.limes.com.pl

The most important: any publications should use UTF-8 or other Unicode
encoding. This is the only working solution for problems mentioned below.

Please note that the keymapping was originally developed for Windows
- that is, Windows Latin encoding was used. This may cause some problems
on other operating systems, unless they are capable of using Unicode.
Unix users may notice lack of code points 128..159, as their ISO-8869-1
specifies them as control chars.

Users of old versions of Mac OS may suffer from wholly different keystrokes.
For them, I made last-resort ps1-mac and ttf-mac versions, re-engineered
so that they should, under certain conditions, work with similar keystrokes
and give correct look for text that was prepared for PC. Please note that
Unicode codes for tengwar are all different, so these re-engineered versions
are absolutely not portable and foreign documents (from the Internet or other
users) may (almost certainly will) look illegible.

14 Sep 2009 (Michał Nowakowski) Tengwar Formal Version 1.2c (bug-fix release)
- Fixed horizontal metrics, that were rubbish, and different between
  "Tengwar Formal" and "Tengwar Formal A". This may result in slightly
  different size than the previous versions.
- Removed GPOS from ttf-mac version - only apple-style kerning is left.
- Truetype versions had different underlines than their postscript/cff
  counterparts.
- One symbol for reverse triple-overdots is encoded as Alt/0173,
  that is - soft hyphen, and often not displayed. Added a duplicate
  at Alt/0128 (Euro Sign).

  of "Tengwar Formal A" most had duplicated contours.
- Fixed self-intersecting contours of alternate letter for "schwa".
- Updated license to SIL OFL 1.1. For details, see LICENSE file.

- Vendor updated to "PfEd".
- TFM files were fixed so that the fonts now can be used with TeX,
  thanks to Ignacio Fernández Galván for pointing the bug out!
- Empty code points were filled with references to .notdef, so that
  no rasterizers should report it broken. These references are hinted.
- Removed broken typographic features from Open Type versions.
- Mac version with changed keymapping - see keymapping section.

9 Mar 2005 (Michał Nowakowski) Version 1.2
- Rómenlike tengwar were widened after suggestions of Harri Perälä.

- Vowel carriers were given a bit more space.
- Additional font "Tengwar Formal A" with some non-standard and
  alternate glyphs is provided.
- Truetypes were given a tiny prep code to enable dropout control
  when rendering. The font looks a bit better, though still unhinted.

D: After looking at examples of Formal Bookhand style in Tengwar Calligraphy,
   it becomes clear that they were main inspiration for creating Tengwar Formal.
   His Tengwar Parmaite font was a also good start point for the design for
   its compatibility with web browsers. Was among first people to evaluate
   Tengwar Formal.
