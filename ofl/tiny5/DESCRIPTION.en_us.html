tiny5 is a variable-width, 5-pixel font playing with the concept of least amount of information while producing both legible and aesthetically pleasing text.
</p>
<p>
It is inspired by the graphing calculators and digital gadgets of the 1980s-90s, where the constraints of limited pixel space demanded efficient and minimalist design. It can be used for invoking a retro or nostalgic feel, for conveying the idea of minimalism, or for efficiently presenting information on small displays.

<p>
tiny5 supports the Google Fonts Latin Kernel, Latin Core, Latin Plus, Latin African, Greek Core, Cyrillic Core and Cyrillic Plus character set.
