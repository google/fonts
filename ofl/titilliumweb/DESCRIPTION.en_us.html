Titillium Web was born inside the Accademia di Belle Arti di Urbino.
Each academic year, a dozen students work on the project developing it further.
Any type designer interested in contributing to the Titillium project is invited to
co-operate with us, or develop their own variants of the typeface according to
the terms specified in the Open Font License.
We also ask all graphic designers who use Titillium in their projects to
<a href="mailto:segreteria@accademiadiurbino.it">email us some examples</a>
of the typeface in use, in order to prepare a case histories database.

<p>
Designer <a href="https://gaber.design">Mohamed Gaber</a>
created a fork of Titillum called <a href="https://github.com/Gue3bara/Cairo">Cairo</a>
that supports the Arabic script and is a variable font.
These updates have been merged back into the Titillium Web font family.
