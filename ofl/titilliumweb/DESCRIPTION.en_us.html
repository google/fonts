<p> Titillium Web’s is a semi modular sans serif with a mildly rounded finish. 
It is a largely geometric typeface, however its rounded finish gives it a warm look. 
This makes Titillium Web suitable for both formal and free- range projects.</p>

<p>Three years after the birth of Titillium, the project is still evolving,
and even we don’t know what it will become in the future.</p>
