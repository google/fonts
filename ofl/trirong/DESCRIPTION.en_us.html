Trirong means &#8220;tricolor flag&#8221; in Thai, and represents the flag of Thailand.
A serif Latin and looped Thai typeface, it is characterized by thick and thin strokes, and its narrow and tall structure echoes that of traditional Thai typefaces. 
It saves space while preserving readability and legibility with its oval-shape looped terminal. 
This looped Thai and Transitional serif Latin works well in formal contexts.

The similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, and ฎ and ฏ is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. 
Trirong takes a specific approach in how it deals with the thick and thin strokes in Thai glyphs. 
Other type designers of Thai fonts may like to use this approach as a reference.
Formal looped Thai typefaces have delicate details, so it is important for type designers to take care when extending them into heavy weights and avoid obscuring important details. 
The sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully too, because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.
