Trocchi is a design derived from a number of old faces from the English
typecutter Vincent Figgins (1766-1844) including Nebiolo’s ‘Egiziano’, and
Caslon & Co’s ‘Antique No.4′ and ‘Ionic No.2′. Trocchi derives from these
earlier designs to produce a more casual slab serif. Trocchi is designed for use
both as text and display type. The font is named after the Scottish novelist
Alexander Trocchi.
