FONTLOG for Trocchi fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Trocchi 
Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the 
Trocchi fonts and any derivative works. 

Basic Font Information

‘Trocchi’ is a design derived from a number of old faces 
from the English typecutter Vincent Figgins (1766-1844) 
including Nebiolo’s ‘Egiziano’, and Caslon & Co’s ‘Antique 
No.4′ and ‘Ionic No.2′. Trocchi derivates from these 
earlier designs to produce a more casual slab serif. 
Trocchi is designed for use both as text and display type. 
The font is named after the Scottish novelist 
Alexander Trocchi.

This release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin, Latin-Extended
