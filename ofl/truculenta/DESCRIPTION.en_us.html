Truculenta is an irregular sans serif typeface based on mid-century lettering works, yet with a little twist. This quirky grotesque is a variable font with three axes (weight, width and optical size), allowing a wide range of text sizes without losing readability. This vibrant typeface is highly suitable for packaging, branding, book covers, illustrated editions, and film titles.
