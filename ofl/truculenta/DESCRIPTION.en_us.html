Truculenta is an irregular sans serif typeface based on mid-century lettering works, yet with a little twist. This new quirky grotesque is a superfamily with variable font format in 3 axes: Width (wdth), Weight (wght) and Optical Size (opsz). This typeface is highly suitable for packaging, branding, book covers, illustrated editions, and film titles, since its personality may be more vibrant than the usual cold neo-grotesque. The text version has been specially designed to compose paragraphs in text sizes.
