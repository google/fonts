    Unbounded is possibly the first open source, freely available and on-chain funded font in the world, thanks to the
    Polkadot treasury.
</p>
<p>
    Unbounded by both name and nature, it is available in eight display weights ranging from Light to Black as a
    variable font. The typeface supports both Latin and Cyrillic scripts with over 1300 individual glyphs,
    including a collection of symbols and a unique figure building system. In addition the sizeable glyph set
    accommodates for hundreds of languages worldwide.
