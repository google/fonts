<p>Uncial Antiqua is a hybrid typeface which combines the speedier penned styles of Uncial and Half Uncial letterforms together in a formal 
text representation. Signature letterforms to the Uncial & Half Uncial styles are not sacrificed in this compilation, 
yet readability is surprisingly maintained when read in context. Suitable for antique-themed projects.</p>
