Vazirmatn is a Persian/Arabic font project that started in 2015 under the name of Vazir with the idea of a new simple and legible typeface suitable for web pages and applications.
Thanks to DejaVu Sans font (v2.35) published in public domain there was a free software base to start the Vazir project. Although Vazir was completely different in typeface, still the original software was common.
For the Latin glyphset, Vazirmatn is combined with <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto">Roboto</a>.
