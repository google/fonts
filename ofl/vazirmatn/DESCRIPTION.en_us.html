<p>
    Vazirmatn is a Persian/Arabic font project that started in 2015 under the name Vazir with the idea of a new
    simple and legible typeface suitable for web pages and applications.
    Thanks to DejaVu Sans font (v2.35) published in public domain there was a free software base to start the Vazir
    project. Although Vazir was a completely different typeface, still the original software was common.
    For the Latin glyphset, Vazirmatn is combined with <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto">Roboto</a>.
</p>

<p>The last release in June 2022, fixes some bugs, improves the design, and offers a more expanded glyphset.</p>
