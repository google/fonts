FONTLOG for Voces font

This file provides detailed information on the 
Voces Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with 
the Voces fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Voces is a new graphic solution for the glyphs of the 
International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), considering the 
specific use-case of bilingual dictionaries. For this 
purpose, the typeface was conceived as a sans serif with
gradual strokes, generous counterforms, a large "x" height, 
and short ascenders and descenders. These features attempt 
to solve the problems of spatial economy and print 
fidelity that dictionary typesetting presents. Ink traps 
were applied with consideration for the aesthetic and 
functional requirements. Voces was selected for exhibition 
in Tipos Latinos 2010.

Voces is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and 
could be expanded to support other scripts.

More specifically, this release supports the following 
Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin Extended A, IPA
