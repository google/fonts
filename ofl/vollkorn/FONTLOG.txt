It has dark and meaty serifs and a bouncing and healthy look and might be used as body type as well as for headlines or titles. More than 2000 glyphs per font support a wide range of languages in Latin, Cyrillic and Greek scripts.»Vollkorn« [pronounce ‘follkorn’] is German for “wholemeal”. It refers to the old term “Brotschrift” [literally ‘bread type’] which described the small fonts for every day use in the days of hand-compositing.Vollkorn came into being as Friedrich Althausen’s first type designing attempt while his studies at Bauhaus University Weimar, Germany. The Regular style was initially published in 2005 under a Creative-Commons-License. When GoogleFonts launched in 2010 Vollkorn was one the first twenty featured fonts.Since 19 May 2010 Vollkorn is published under the OFL.Original Designers address: Friedrich Althausen, friedrichalthausen.de, Germanyvollkorn-typeface.comChangeLog–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––(This should list both major and minor changes, most recent first.)22nd March 2017 (Friedrich Althausen) Vollkorn Version 4.014- Fixed vert Metrics- Fixed Semibold Italic’s usWeightClass- Added SC Instances1st March 2017 (Friedrich Althausen) Vollkorn Version 4.012- Support of »GoogleFonts Latin Pro«, »GoogleFonts Latin Plus«, »GoogleFonts Latin Expert«, »GoogleFonts Cyrillic Pro«, »GoogleFonts Cyrillic Plus«, »GoogleFonts Greek Core«, »GoogleFonts Vietnamese«, »Adobe Latin 3«, »Adobe Cyrillic 3« and more - Smallcaps- character count increase from 535 up to over 2000- etc.18 March 2014 (Friedrich Althausen) Vollkorn Version 3.005- fixing of catalan l•l and L•L- fixing of version counters and style linking- added underlinePosition and underlineThickness 5 February 2014 (Friedrich Althausen) Vollkorn Version 3.003- fix dot of j again31 January 2014 (Friedrich Althausen) Vollkorn Version 3.002- minor changes: semibold name fix, corrected small g-commaaccent, tidied up automatic metrics7 January 2014 (Friedrich Althausen) Vollkorn Version 3.001- minor corrections (added non-breaking space, hinting stuff) - now on own webpage: vollkorn-typeface.com29 December 2013 (Friedrich Althausen, Potsdam) Vollkorn Version 3.0- adding several characters (now 533 in the romans, 456 in the italics)- full support of “Adobe Latin 3” - basic cyrillic in the roman styles- interpolation of 4 new styles: medium, medium italic, semibold, semibold italic- new tt-hinting with the ttf-autohinter15 September 2010 (Yanone) Vollkorn Version 2.1- fixing TT-Hinting: droping-out horizontal strokes at 14 px07 September 2010 (Friedrich Althausen, supported by Yanone) Vollkorn Version 2.1- Initial release of the styles Vollkorn Italic and Bold-Italic- Small improvements in the Regular and Bold styles19 May 2010 (Friedrich Althausen, supported by Yanone) Vollkorn Version 2.0- Initial release of the fonts Vollkorn Regular and Bold under the SIL OFL 1.1late 2005 (Friedrich Althausen) Vollkorn Version 1.0- First release of Vollkorn under the Creative Commons License “Attribution 2.0 Germany”Acknowledgements–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––(Here is where contributors can be acknowledged.
