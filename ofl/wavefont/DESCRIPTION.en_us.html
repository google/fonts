<p>Wavefont is a variable font with Weight, Round, and Vertical Alignment axes for rendering data like waveforms, spectrums, diagrams, and bars.</p>

<p>Wavefont bars correspond to values from 0 to 100, assigned to different characters:
    <ul>
        <li>0-9 chars are for simplified manual input with step 10 (bar height = number).</li>
        <li>a-z/A-Z for manual input with step 2, softened at edges a and Z (bar height = number of letter).</li>
        <li>U+0100-017F for 0..127 values with step 1.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>letter-spacing CSS property with ch units is useful to adjust distance between bars, 1ch === 1 bar width.</p>
