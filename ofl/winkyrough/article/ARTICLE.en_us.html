    Winky Rough is the roughed variant of Winky Sans (https://github.com/typofactur/winkysans) imitating dried ink on rough paper.
</p>
<p>
    Unlike its counterpart Winky Sans, Winky Rough is not a variable font (yet). Winky Sans is available in seven weights from Light (300) to Black (900).
</p>

    But be careful! Like flowing ink on paper the forms grows in all directions. While the slim weights might have been written with a fineliner, the black style look like ink blots from a broken pen.
