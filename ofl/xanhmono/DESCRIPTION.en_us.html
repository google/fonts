Xanh Mono is a mono-serif typeface, designed by Lam Bao and Duy Dao. 
In Vietnamese, “Xanh” has a lot of meanings, including blue; green; young; etc. We believe that Xanh Mono will not only present a fresh and gentle look, but also a stylish and unique approach for both reading and display purposes.
