  Yaldevi is a narrow font intended for titles and short texts in the web supporing Latin and Sinhala scripts.
</p>
<p>
  Condensed shapes and dimensions make it possible to fit more text in a line. The x-height of Latin and body height of Sinhala is generous, and has short ascenders and descenders, increasing the space efficiency.
  It has a somewhat neutral personality with a touch of soft and smooth curves that add some whimsy.
  Yaldevi will perform well when used in headlines, subheads and shorter text blocks such as pull quotes.
  Sinhala glyphs have some peculiarities and experimental shapes that were invented to perform well as a display face while belonging in the formal text typeface category. Make sure you check out all these features before using it.
