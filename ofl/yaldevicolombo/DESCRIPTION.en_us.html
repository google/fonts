Yaldevi is designed for display use, such as headlines, subheads, and short paragraphs, such as pull quotes. 
The almost neutral personality has a touch of whimsicality with the soft and smooth curves. 
The lighter weights are pleasingly beautiful and stylish, making it a delightful headline font. 
Slightly condensed shapes and dimensions make it possible to fit more text into single lines. 
The name means ‘Princes of Jaffna’ in Tamil and Sinhala, and is taken from the name of the intercity train in Sri Lanka that runs between Colombo and the Northern city of Jaffna.

Yaldevi Colombo includes Sinhala and Latin glyphs, and some peculiar and experimental shapes that were invented to enhance the performance as a display typeface. 
Yaldevi Jaffna includes Tamil and Latin glyphs, and is designed with open counters and an overall friendly feel. 
Both are available in 6 weights, ExtraLight to ExtraBold, and can be used together in multilingual projects as they share the same vertical metrics.  
The Sinhala is designed by Denzil Rajitha, the Tamil by Pathum Egodawatta and Kosala Senevirathne, and the Latin by Sol Matas.
