Yaldevi, a font family that supports Latin, Tamil and Sinhala languages. Released on Google Fonts as Yaldevi Colombo and Yaldevi Jaffna, these two font families include Sinhala and Tamil glyphs and can be used together in multi-script web projects as they share the same vertical matrix and aesthtics.The slightly condensed shapes and dimensions of Yaldevi make it possible to fit more text in one line. The x-height of Latin and body heights of Sinhala and Tamil are generous, and the short ascenders and descenders increase space efficiency. This font has an almost neutral personality with a touch of soft and smooth curves that add a touch of whimsicalness.

Yaldevi performs well in terms of headlines, sub-headlines and short paragraphs for web such as quotes and other text extracts. The Tamil glyphs are designed to cater to the same typographic needs, equipped with open counters together with a friendly feel. The Sinhala glyphs have some peculiarities and experimental shapes that were invented to perform well as a display typeface. Yaldevi is available in six weights, Extra Bold to Extra Light and the extra light weight is pleasingly beautiful and stylish making it a delightful headline font.
