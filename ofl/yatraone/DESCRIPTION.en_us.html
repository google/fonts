Yatra One is a Devanagari and Latin libre font inspired by the hand-painted signage of the Mumbai local railway. 
This heavy weight high-contrast display face preserves the idiosyncratic character of brush-painted signage by featuring angular cuts and open knots. 
Notably, the Latin adopts a Devanagari brush angle.
A Mumbai native, Yatra offers basic Marathi alternates.
