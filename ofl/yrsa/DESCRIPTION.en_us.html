Intended for continuous reading on the web (longer articles in online news, magazines, blogs), Yrsa supports over 92
languages. A special consideration was given to Central and East European languages and proper shaping of their
accents.
A version that also supports 2 languages in the Gujarati script (Gujarati and Kachchi), is available as <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Rasa">Rasa</a>. In terms of glyphs included Rasa is a superset of
Yrsa and includes the complete Latin, but in Rasa the Latin may be adjusted to support the primary Gujarati font.

It is a deliberate experiment in remixing existing typefaces: 
The Latin part began with Eben Sorkin's <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather">Merriweather</a>.
The Gujarati began with David Březina’s <a href="https://www.rosettatype.com/Skolar#gujarati">Skolar Gujarati</a>.
