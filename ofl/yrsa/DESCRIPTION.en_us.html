Yrsa supports over 92 languages and is intended for continuous reading on the web - longer articles in online news, magazines, blogs, and so on.
A special consideration was given to Central and East European languages and proper shaping of their accents.
A version that also supports 2 languages in the Gujarati script (Gujarati and Kachchi), is available as <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Rasa">Rasa</a>.
In terms of glyphs included, Rasa is a superset of Yrsa and includes the complete Latin plus Gujarati, but the Latin is also adjusted there to support the Gujarati as primary.

What makes the Yrsa and Rasa project different is the design approach - a deliberate experiment in remixing existing typefaces:
The Latin part began with Eben Sorkin's <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather">Merriweather</a>;
the Gujarati began with David Březina’s <a href="https://www.rosettatype.com/Skolar#gujarati">Skolar Gujarati</a>.
The project design and production was done in-house by Anna Giedryś and David Březina.

The Yrsa and Rasa project is led by Rosetta Type, a type design foundry based in Europe.
