    Ysabeau combines the familiar timeless letterforms of the Garamond legacy with the unencumbered crispness of a clean
    low-contrast sans serif. Unlike other humanist sans, Ysabeau retains the confident wide stride and unapologetic
    extenders of the world's favorite book face for unmitigated reading comfort. Try it on your e-reader and never look
    back! Pair it with <i>EB Garamond</i> or <i>Cormorant</i> for a perfect match, or blow it up to page-filling sizes
    and revel in its elegance.

    Ysabeau offers extensive Latin, Greek and Cyrillic.
