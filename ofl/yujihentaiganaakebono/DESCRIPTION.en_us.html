    "Yuji" is a series of fonts digitizing handwriting by the calligrapher Yuji Kataoka. Akebono is a "Hentaigana" font which contains stylistic alternate versions of the standard Hiragana set that were abandoned in 1900 during a script reform.
</p>
<p>
    As there are no Hentaigana for Katakana, no Katakana are included. Latin is all-caps / small caps.
