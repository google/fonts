Yusei Magic is a font based on handwritten letters written with permanent marker. It has a thick vertical stroke and a thin horizontal stroke, so it is highly visible. The design of the letters has both the strength of bold lines and the softness of spaciousness. Highly recommended for handwriting on blackboards and pop art designs.
