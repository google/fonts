 The objectives behind the Zain range of typefaces was to create a unique modern range (7 weights: Extralight, Light, Regular, Italic, Bold, ExtraBold and Black ) that support Arabic and Latin languages as well as Urdu, Farsi, Kurdish, Indonesian and Tagalog.
 It's suitable for headlines, sub-headings and body text, respecting Arabic calligraphy and cultural rules with maximum legibility.
 A key design objective has been the harmony between the Latin and the Arabic and its suitability for all communications needs, whether in print or on the web.

 Until the Roman and the Italic are available with an equal number of weights (currently they're not), the Roman will be available as "Zain" while the Italic will be available as "Zain Italic".
