 Zain Group (zain.com) is a leading provider of innovative technologies and digital lifestyle communications operating 
 in eight markets across the Middle East and Africa. The objectives behind the Zain range of typefaces were to create a 
 unique modern range (8 weights: ExtraLight, Light, Regular, Italic, Bold, ExtraBold, Black and LightItalic ) that 
 supports Arabic and Latin languages as well as Urdu, Farsi, Kurdish, Indonesian and Tagalog. 
 It's suitable for headlines, sub-headings and body text, respecting Arabic calligraphy and cultural rules with maximum legibility. 
 A key design objective has been the harmony between the Latin and the Arabic and its suitability for all communications needs, 
 whether in print or on the web.
