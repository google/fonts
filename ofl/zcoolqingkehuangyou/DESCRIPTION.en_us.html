ZCool QingKe HuangYou was designed and produced by Zheng Qingke, and donated to the ZCOOL font project for public use.
It features innovative character shapes and rounded lines, with right angles adjusted to a rounded 4pt corner radius.
The lower right corner of the radicals are notched at a 45 degree angle, which raises the visual center of the font, effectively solving readability issues due to stroke crossing.
