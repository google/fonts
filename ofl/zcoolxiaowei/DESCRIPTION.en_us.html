ZCOOL XiaoWei was contributed to the ZCOOL font project by designer Li Dawei and the team at Zuozi, who created the typeface as a gift for David’s daughter, “Little Fern”, on her third birthday.
It is intended to help fill the dearth of logo-ready Chinese display fonts.
The brush strokes are agile and recognizable, with spacing optimized to display at small or large sizes.
