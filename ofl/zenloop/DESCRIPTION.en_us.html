Zen Loop Family is one of three Latin fonts designed by Yoshimichi Ohira, as part of Zen Fonts collection.

<p>
Japanese kana characters contain many loops.
Zen Loop and Zen Loop Italic incorporates this visual aspect into a Latin font.
The font looks as though it was shaped out of a thin wire, and almost depicts the movements of a living organism.
