<p>Zephirum is designed for good readability and legibility. Its distinctive, machine-readable design makes it ideal for technical documentation, coding environments, and any application requiring clear, consistent character spacing.</p>
<p>The Arabic word Ṣifr (صفر), meaning "empty" or "nothing," was introduced to Europe through Islamic mathematics. Fibonacci later Latinized it as "Zephirum", which evolved into the modern word "zero."</p>
