Zilla Slab is Mozilla's core typeface, used for the Mozilla wordmark, headlines and throughout their designs. 
A contemporary slab serif, based on Typotheque's Tesla, it is constructed with smooth curves and true italics, which gives text an unexpectedly sophisticated industrial look and a friendly approachability in all weights.
