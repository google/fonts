```
DZ
Dz

```

### Armenian Dram ###

Stacked Vietnamese accents may require custom tailoring. This can be achieved by adding additional accents. Glyphs will automatically place these newly created accents were applicable.

### Polish Kreska ###

Polish Kreska shares the same unicode as the acute accent, however it is designed differently. Explore Adam Twardoch's guidelines on [Polish Kreska](2)

Here is a list of additional glyphs for better Polish support:

```
Cacute.loclPLK Nacute.loclPLK Oacute.loclPLK Sacute.loclPLK Zacute.loclPLK cacute.loclPLK nacute.loclPLK oacute.loclPLK sacute.loclPLK zacute.loclPLK acutecomb.loclPLK acutecomb.loclPLK.case
```

### STRASSE or Straße? ###

The Google Lating Plus encoding includes **ẞ Germandbls U+1E9E**. 

Does your font include Small Capitals?
For better compatibility you may consider adding the germandbls.calt glyph to access ẞ U+1E9E in Small Caps fonts. In Glyphs go to *Glyph > Add Glyphs*, and paste this code:

```
Germandbls=germandbls.calt
```
	
Add this calt feature:

```
sub @Uppercase germandbls' @Uppercase by germandbls.calt;
sub @Uppercase @Uppercase germandbls' by germandbls.calt;
```

### Duodecimal(dozenal) notation

Add these glyphs for single-digit representations of numbers 10 and 11.

```
U+218A (turned digit two) 
U+218B (turned digit three)
```
