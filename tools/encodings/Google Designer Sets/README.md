Google Fonts 2016 Glyph Sets
====================================================

Three levels of glyph sets were developed in June 2016 as a new baseline standard for fonts in the Google Fonts library. 
Exising fonts in the library can be upgraded to these as part of a drive towards new quality standards. 
All new fonts submitted to the library must now support the Plus level as a minumum requirement.

Three sets are available in this directory: **Plus, Pro and Expert.**

### Glyphs App Tip

Inside **FilterLists** are text files with a list of glyphs for each set. 
Open Glyphs and in the left bottom sidebar, create a new list filter, and paste the contents of these files to check if your fonts supports these characters. A ✓ will indicate you are all set. Otherwise **ctrl + click** on the numbers to generate missing glyphs.
