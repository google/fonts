The <a href="http://font.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu Font Family</a> are a set of matching new libre/open fonts in development during 2010-2011, with further expansion work and bug 
fixing in 2015 and 2022-2023. 
The development is being funded by Canonical Ltd on behalf the wider Free Software community and the Ubuntu project. 
The technical font design work and implementation has been undertaken by <a href="http://www.daltonmaag.com/">Dalton Maag</a>, <a href="https://typenetwork.com">Type Network</a>, <a href="https://djr.com">DJR</a>, and <a href="https://dualtype.design">Dual Type</a>.
</p>
<p>
Both the final font Truetype/OpenType files and the design files used to produce the font family are distributed under an open licence and you are expressly encouraged to experiment, modify, share and improve.
</p>
<p>
The new Ubuntu Font Family was started to enable the personality of Ubuntu to be seen and felt in every menu, button and dialog. 
</p>
<p>
The scope of the Ubuntu Font Family includes all the languages used by the various Ubuntu users around the world in tune with Ubuntu's philosophy which states that every user should be able to use their software in the language of their choice. 
So the Ubuntu Font Family project will be extended to cover many more written languages.
